  <meta name="description" content="'Thom Hartmann Politics and Culture in the Age of Casino Capitalism' 
    capitalizes upon the popularity of zombies, exploring the relevance of the metaphor they 
    provide for examining the political and pedagogical conditions that have produced a growing 
    culture of sadism, cruelty, disposability, and death in America. The zombie metaphor may seem 
    extreme, but it is particularly apt for drawing attention to the ways in which political 
    culture and power in American society now operate on a level of mere survival. This website 
    uses the metaphor not only to suggest the symbolic face of power: beginning and ending with 
    an analysis of authoritarianism, it attempts to mark and chart the visible registers of a kind 
    of zombie politics, including the emergence of right-wing teaching machines, a growing politics 
    of disposability, the emergence of a culture of cruelty, and the ongoing war being waged on 
    young people, especially on youth of color. By drawing attention to zombie politics and 
    authoritarianism, this website aims to break through the poisonous common sense that often 
    masks zombie politicians, anti-public intellectuals, politics, institutions, and social 
    relations, and bring into focus a new language, pedagogy, and politics in which the living 
    dead will be moved decisively to the margins rather than occupying the very center of politics 
    and everyday life. American international politics is half-court tennis. Rarely is the other
    side of the tennis court even considered in their policies.">

          CREATING THE AMERICAN DREAM IN ITS MODERN FORM</h2>
        <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Although both presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald 
            Reagan quoted Puritan leader John Winthrop’s 1630 “city on a hill” speech 
            (Reagan added the word “shining”) when referencing our land of opportunity, 
            the expression “American Dream” originates with historian James Truslow Adams 
            and his 1931 book The Epic of America.[xix] He describes “that dream of a land 
            in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with 
            opportunity for each according to ability or achievement.”</p>
          <p>He was expressing a sentiment held by most of the Founders of this country 
            and the Framers of the Constitution, as well as foreign observers and leading 
            American philosophers throughout history. Alexis de Tocqueville in the 1830s 
            called it “the charm of anticipated success.” Henry David Thoreau, in Walden, 
            wrote in 1854: “If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, 
            and endeavors to live the life he has imagined, he will meet with a success 
            unexpected in common hours.”[xx]</p>
          <p>The phrase “American dream” was first used widely during the Progressive Era 
            (1888-1920) and originally meant something quite different from today: it meant 
            justice, equality, and democracy during a time when the nation was run by 
            oligarchs, politicians were bought-off (so much so that states added ballot 
            initiatives to their constitutions to get around the problem), and workers 
            were routinely murdered for wanting to unionize.</p>
          <p>In this context, “the American dream” began to appear in newspaper articles and books; 
            arguably President Grover Cleveland was referring to it when he gave his second State 
            of the Union speech in 1888 and said:</p>
          <blockquote>
            “We discover that the fortunes realized by our manufacturers are no longer solely the 
            reward of sturdy industry and enlightened foresight, but that they result from the 
            discriminating favor of the Government and are largely built upon undue exactions from 
            the masses of our people. The gulf between employers and the employed is constantly 
            widening, and classes are rapidly forming, one comprising the very rich and powerful, 
            while in another are found the toiling poor.
            “As we view the achievements of aggregated capital, we discover the existence of trusts, 
            combinations, and monopolies, while the citizen is struggling far in the rear or is 
            trampled to death beneath an iron heel. Corporations, which should be the carefully 
            restrained creatures of the law and the servants of the people, are fast becoming the 
            people's masters.”[xxi]
          </blockquote>
          <p>But the expression became cemented in the American vernacular in 1931 with JT Adams’ 
            book, although at the time many were doubtful; it was the depth of the Republican Great 
            Depression. As FDR put America back together and created the nation’s first comprehensive 
            social safety net, the idea began to acquire its modern context of American government 
            providing the fertile soil for people to achieve their personal “dream.”</p>
          <p>Prior to the full enactment of Progressive Era and New Deal reforms, the American middle 
            class was relatively small and mostly limited to professionals like physicians, attorneys, 
            and those in business management.</p>
          <p>We practiced largely unregulated capitalism until the 1930s, and the tiny class of 
            morbidly rich people (that unregulated capitalism always produces) largely controlled 
            our political system through most of our nation’s history, particularly from the early 
            Industrial Revolution 1870s through the 1930s when President Franklin Roosevelt directly 
            challenged those who he called the “Economic Royalists.”[xxii]</p>
          <p>As recently as 1900, for example, poverty stalked America and farmers were at the mercy 
            of the weather. There was no minimum wage; when workers tried to organize unions police 
            would help employers beat or even murder their ringleaders; and social safety net 
            programs like unemployment insurance, Social Security, Medicare, food and housing 
            supports, and Medicaid didn’t exist.</p>
          <p>There was no income tax to pay for such programs, and federal receipts were a mere 3 
            percent of GDP (today they’re around 20 percent[xxiii]).  As the President’s Council of 
            Economic Advisors noted in their 2000 Annual Report:</p>
          <blockquote>
            “To appreciate how far we have come, it is instructive to look back on what American life 
            was like in 1900. At the turn of the century, fewer than 10 percent of homes had 
            electricity, and fewer than 2 percent of people had telephones. An automobile was a 
            luxury that only the very wealthy could afford.
            “Many women still sewed their own clothes and gave birth at home. Because chlorination 
            had not yet been introduced and water filtration was rare, typhoid fever, spread by 
            contaminated water, was a common affliction. One in 10 children died in infancy. 
            Average life expectancy was a mere 47 years.
            “Fewer than 14 percent of Americans graduated from high school. ... Widowhood was far 
            more common than divorce [because of the dire economic consequences to women of 
            divorce]. The average household had close to five members, and a fifth of all households 
            had seven or more. …
            “Average income per capita, in 1999 dollars, was about $4,200. … The typical workweek in 
            manufacturing was about 50 hours, 20 percent longer than the average today.”[xxiv]
          </blockquote>
          <p>The Progressive Era laid the groundwork for President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal, 
            which he rolled out after his inauguration in March 1933. The major pre-FDR Progressive 
            Era accomplishments included:</p>
          <p>— The 16th Amendment (1913) established the ability of Congress to create and levy a tax 
            on personal income and corporate profits. Prior to that, most government functions were 
            funded by tariffs on foreign goods, which paid for almost all federal functions from the 
            George Washington to the Abraham Lincoln administrations, about two-thirds of government 
            from Lincoln to Wilson, and about a third of government until the mid-20th century as 
            “free trade” collapsed tariffs while leading to an explosion of foreign-made goods in 
            American stores.[xxv] Lacking the revenue from an income tax served as a limit on the 
            size and functions of the federal government; the passage of the 16th Amendment set the 
            stage for the New Deal and subsequent expansion of federal programs to this day.</p>
          <p>- The 17th Amendment (1913) ended the practice of state governments appointing US 
            senators and turned that choice over to each state’s voters. Prior to that, wealthy 
            people and big businesses would make sure their choice of senators were put into office 
            by essentially bribing state legislators and governors. The event that most conspicuously 
            led to the 17th Amendment was when William Clark, a Montana copper baron and one of 
            America’s richest men, reportedly stood outside the doors of the Montana legislature in 
            1898 as they voted on that state’s next US senator. Clark, the story goes, had a 
            pocketful of white envelopes in his jacket pocket, each containing a crisp new $1000 
            bill, which he passed out to each legislator who’d voted for him as they left the 
            chamber. The national outrage was so severe that the Senate first refused to seat Clark, 
            then forced his resignation in 1899 with a motion to void his position. Montana’s 
            legislators, not forgetting his great wealth and many favors, returned him to the US 
            Senate in 1900, where he served from 1901 until 1907.[xxvi]</p>
          <p>— The 19th Amendment (1920) nationally enfranchised women. This amendment to give women 
            the right to vote across the country was written by Susan B. Anthony, and passed both 
            the House and Senate in 1878, with Wisconsin and Illinois being the first states to 
            ratify it. It failed to reach the threshold of three-quarters of the states, however, 
            until 1919 and was certified and put into law on August 26, 1920. The first state to 
            enfranchise women was Wyoming, which, in 1869, passed a law allowing women to vote, 
            own and inherit property, have legal custody of their own children, and hold public 
            office.[xxvii] That was, not coincidentally, the year that Susan B. Anthony and 
            Elizabeth Cady Stanton established the National Woman’s Suffrage Association.[xxviii]</p>
          <p>— The Sherman Anti-Trust Act (1890)[xxix] and the Clayton Antitrust Act (1914)[xxx], 
            both designed to stop and unwind the excesses of the morbidly rich and the giant 
            corporations they controlled.</p>
          <p>— Both federal and state-by-state legislation regulating working hours and conditions, 
            improving sanitary living conditions and open spaces in big cities, and protecting 
            consumers from fraud and hustlers.</p>
          <p>The Progressive Era came to an end with the election of conservative Republican Warren 
            Harding in 1920. Harding campaigned on two major slogans: “A return to normalcy”[xxxi] 
            and “Less government in business and more business in government.”[xxxii]  The 
            “normalcy” slogan was a promise to drop President Woodrow Wilson’s 91 percent top 
            income tax bracket down to 25 percent, and the second slogan essentially meant 
            “privatize and deregulate.” </p>
          <p>Harding did all three, causing (through his, Coolidge’s, and Hoover’s Republican 
            administrations between 1921-1932) an explosion in the stock market creating 
            “Roaring 20’s” piles of cash for the very, very rich while crushing unions and 
            driving down working-class wages. </p>
          <p>Harding’s conservative era ended abruptly when his deregulation of the banking and 
             securities industries led straight to the stock market crash of 1929 and what was 
            then called the Republican Great Depression.</p>

        “Necessitous men are not free men”</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Most Americans, even today, would tell you that 
            being in the middle class enhances their sense of freedom and liberty, even 
            though they don’t realize that a middle class is not a normal thing for 
            capitalist societies.</p>
          <p>But the simple reality is that middle classes must be created, and that 
            requires government intervention in the marketplace and government guarantees 
            of some services that otherwise aren’t available to average working people 
            (like free roads, public schools, and the ability to join a union).</p>
          <p>During the era from 1933 to 1980, Americans held a very specific view of 
            “freedom” and “liberty.” Both were recognized as explicit by-products of 
            government providing a foundation for family life and a fertile soil of 
            financial, legal, and physical infrastructure in which business could 
            root itself.</p>
          <p>The foundation for a freedom-based family life was accomplished by laws 
            and regulations that prevented corporate exploitation of workers, free 
            public schools and near-free college, and widespread access to inexpensive 
            healthcare.</p>
          <p>The needs of business promoted by the construction of infrastructure that 
            business could use to deliver products to market (railroads, highways, 
            airports) and clear, specific rules and regulations of business activity to, 
            as much as was both possible and reasonable, give even small and new 
            businesses an opportunity to grow and thrive.</p>
          <p>FDR himself outlined this in his 1944 fireside chat on “the state of the 
            union”:</p>
          <blockquote>
            “We have come to a clear realization of the fact, however, that true individual freedom 
            cannot exist without economic security and independence. Necessitous men are not free 
            men. People who are hungry, people who are out of a job are the stuff of which 
            dictatorships are made.

            “In our day these economic truths have become accepted as self-evident. We have 
            accepted, so to speak, a second Bill of Rights under which a new basis of security 
            and prosperity can be established for all — regardless of station, or race or creed.”[xxxiii]
          </blockquote>
          <p>Republicans (with the exception of President Dwight Eisenhower, who the 
            John Birch Society famously called a communist[xxxiv]) broadly rejected 
            FDR’s definitions of freedom and liberty, arguing instead that the words 
            meant an absence of government “intrusion” into individual and corporate 
            life.</p>
          <p>They’ve been trying to undo or reverse FDR’s New Deal ever since it was put 
            into place in the 1930s, including campaigning for privatizing everything 
            from Social Security to the national highway system.[xxxv] [xxxvi]</p>
          <p>When FDR came into office in 1933, only 12 percent of Americans were in the 
            middle class and, as noted earlier, most were professional people like 
            doctors and lawyers.[xxxvii]<br>
            By 1980, fully two-thirds of American families were middle class — with a 
            single income — because about a third of American workers were unionized 
            and those union contracts set the local wage and benefits floors for 
            another third of non-union employers and workers.</p>
          <p>Thus, when Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected president, he kicked off the 
            country’s longest (48 years) second progressive era bringing back high taxes 
            on the rich, putting the right to unionize into law, and building the largest 
            and wealthiest middle class in world history.</p>

            that legalized and gave federal protection to unions and their members, while 
            putting jobless Americans back to work with a variety of three- and four-letter 
            federal agencies (referred to at the time as “the alphabet agencies”) that 
            ultimately spent over $3 billion to lift over 20 million people out of 
            unemployment and poverty. They principally included a number of programs 
            that Republicans mercilessly attacked as “socialism”:</p>
          <p>— The Works Progress Administration (WPA)[xxxix] spent $11 million and put 
		    8.5 million people to work building bridges, roads, public buildings, public 
			parks, and airports. It was shut down in 1943, as by then most of the men it 
			employed had been drafted for the anti-fascist (Antifa) war effort. During 
			its existence the WPA built 650,000 miles of roads, 78,000 bridges, 125,000 
			buildings, and 700 miles of airport runways, reshaping the infrastructure 
			of America and providing a launching pad for the economic vitality of the 
			1950-1980 era.</p>
          <p>— The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)[xl] planted over 200 million trees 
		    (along with shrubs and grassland to fix soil), built national parks, and 
			revived farmland that had been destroyed by poor agricultural practices, 
			employing 2.5 million single young men and 8,500 young women before it 
			ended in 1942. Its efforts, part of a larger FDR enterprise called the 
			Great Plains Shelterbelt Project, helped reverse the effects of the 
			Dust Bowl by planting windbreaks of trees from Texas to North Dakota. 
			By 1941 most of America was again receiving normal levels of rainfall.</p>
          <p>— The National Youth Administration (NYA)[xli] provided student work, 
		    employment, and skills training programs to over 4.5 million Americans 
			between the ages of 16 and 25. In part because the program explicitly 
			reached out to young women and African Americans, Republicans decried 
			it as “communist” and made multiple efforts to shut it down; it 
			ceased operations in 1943.</p>
          <p>— The Farm Security Administration (FSA)[xlii] loaned over a billion 
		    dollars to farmers hard-hit by the Dust Bowl and set up camps across 
			the west coast to house refugees from Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas 
			whose farms had been wiped out. Its genesis was, in part, traceable 
			to John Steinbeck’s’ novel The Grapes of Wrath about the plight of poor 
			farmers and agricultural workers during that era.</p>
          <p>— The Rural Electrification Administration (REA)[xliii], which still 
		    exists, took on the challenge of only 10 percent of Americans who didn’t 
			live in cities having electricity. The program brought electricity to 98 
			percent of America’s farms and helped establish the nearly 900 rural 
			electric co-ops that dot the nation today.</p>
          <p>— The Federal Housing Administration (FHA)[xliv] is today the largest 
		    insurer of home mortgages in the world, having helped tens of millions of 
			Americans buy homes (and nonprofits to build hospitals) since its creation 
			in 1934.</p>
          <p>— The Federal Emergency Works Administration (FERA)[xlv] only lasted from 
		    1933 to 1935 and was replaced by the WPA, but in its two years it provided 
			employment to over 20 million Americans and gave vaccinations and literacy 
			classes to millions.</p>
          <p>— The Civil Works Administration (CWA)[xlvi] lasted only one year (1933-1934), 
		    but in that year put over four million people to work building schools, roads, 
			and sewers.</p>
          <p>Other agencies didn’t directly employ large numbers of people but helped set 
		    the stage for the emergence of America’s first widespread middle class (and 
			thus created the opportunities for them to attain “the American Dream”) by 
			providing the necessary governmental infrastructure to stabilize business 
			and prevent predation by the morbidly rich.</p>
          <dl>
            <dt><strong>They included</strong></dt>
            <dd>— The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)[xlvii] regulated radio and 
              eventually television and the internet.</dd>
            <dd>— The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)[xlviii] guaranteed 
              bank deposits so never again would Americans lose everything when rich 
              bankers ran off with their money and shut down the bank (as happened to 
              millions in the banking panic of 1932-1933).</dd>
            <dd>— The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)[xlix] was created in 1934 
              to regulate Wall Street and investment houses. FDR put Joe Kennedy in 
              charge of the agency, telling my late friend Gloria Swanson that he did 
              so “because it takes a crook to catch a crook.”</dd>
            <dd>— The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB),[l] created by the Wagner Act 
              in 1935, protects the rights of unionized workers and oversees things like 
              union elections.</dd>
            <dd>— The Social Security Administration (SSA)[li] was created with the Social 
              Security Act in 1935. Designed as “poverty insurance,” it gives every American 
              of all ages a comprehensive insurance policy against personal disasters. 
              People who’ve suffered disabilities from accident, illness, or birth defects 
              qualify and Social Security will pay for housing and care as long as needed. 
              The program also pays a retirement benefit to the elderly.
              </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>Building on the foundation of the “administrative state” that FDR created in 
		    the 1930s, presidents of both parties have since passed sweeping social safety 
			net programs including Unemployment Insurance, the Minimum Wage (both 
			established by FDR’s New Deal), Medicare and Medicaid (LBJ), expanded 
			government protections of workers and the environment, and built massive 
			government-funded infrastructure programs including the TVA (also FDR’s), the 
			Eisenhower Highway System, and the Hoover Dam.</p>
          <p>Most recently, President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act hearkened back 
		    to FDR and LBJ, using tax incentives and direct investment to stimulate 
			American manufacturing and raise the wages of US workers. So far, it’s been 
			an overwhelming success, keeping the economy humming while reducing inflation 
			faster than in any other developed country in the world.</p>

        Expanding the base of the middle class</h2>
        <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">The middle class was, until the 1970s, largely the 
		    province of single-wage-earning married white men and their families. Through 
			the 1960s, following passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 and the Voting 
			Rights Act in 1965, African Americans and other minorities who had previously 
			been shut out of the professions and management positions, and even excluded 
			from most unions, began to find new opportunities as the result of anti-
			discrimination legislation.</p>
          <p>The legalization of the birth control pill in 1961, and the nationwide 
		    legalization of birth control in 1965 with the Supreme Court’s Griswold 
			decision, similarly brought a wave of women into the workforce. Women 
			could now delay childbearing and plan for their futures, giving them 
			access to more educational and economic opportunities.</p>
          <p>When Sandra Day O’Connor graduated from law school in 1953, number 3 in her class 
academically, the only job she could find in the private sector was as a legal 
secretary.[lii] By the 1970s things had begun to change substantially.</p>

          <p>In 1960, for example, fully 94 percent of all medical doctors in America were white 
men. By 2010, that number had dropped to 60 percent, as women and minorities gained 
admittance to medical school and made their way into careers as physicians.</p>

As researchers from the University of Chicago and Stanford found and laid out in an 
in-depth paper published in 2019:</p>

          <p>“We find that one-fifth of U.S. market GDP growth can be explained by falling labor 
market barriers, falling human capital barriers, and shifting occupational preferences. 
Much of the productivity gains come from drawing women and black men into high-skilled 
occupations.”</p>

          <p>In political terms, this has very much been a two-edged sword.
          While expanding the number of people who can enter the better-paid parts of the job 
market has increased the efficiency and fairness of our labor markets — and, thus, the 
overall efficiency and fairness of our entire society — it’s also provided a ready foil 
for Republicans to claim conspiracy and victimhood.</p>

          <p>As mentioned elsewhere, the American middle class peaked at about two-thirds of us just 
as Ronald Reagan was taking office and his neoliberal Reaganomics policies were first 
put into place. Between his war on labor unions, offshoring our factories, and his 
cutting income tax rates (more on that in a bit), Reagan’s policies — kept in place for 
over 40 years now — have succeeded in so gutting the middle class that today only 43 
percent of Americans qualify as middle class. To make matters worse, today it takes 
two full-time incomes to achieve the lifestyle a single union job could provide in 
1981.[liii]</p>

          <p>Most Americans — particularly those old enough to remember the middle class of the 1950s 
through the 1980s era — know this. They may not know the details, and they certainly 
don’t know the causes, but they know for a fact they’ve been screwed by government and 
corporate policies over the past 40-plus years.</p>

          <p>But as largely Republican policies (Clinton and Obama both also bought into 
neoliberalism, as I lay out in detail in The Hidden History of Neoliberalism, but 
these ideas began with Reagan and the GOP) have cut the number of good jobs available 
to working class white men, Republican politicians have stepped up to offer those now-
impoverished white workers a ready boogeyman, complete with a simplistic explanation 
for their plight.</p>

          <p>They tell their voters with a straight face: “It’s all because Blacks, Hispanics, and 
women have entered the job market! We need to return to the exclusionary policies of 
the 1950s!”</p>

          <p>In fact, the entry of women and minorities previously excluded from good jobs has 
increased American productivity and the general prosperity of the nation. That worker-
driven productivity, however, has barely kept pace with an expanding economy, as 
Florida painfully learned in 2023 when Governor Ron DeSantis signed a draconian law 
heavily criminalizing undocumented immigrants and many fled the state.[liv] When 
Hurricane Idalia, fueled to super-storm status by global warming, hit the state and 
destroyed tens of thousands of homes and businesses, the price of labor to rebuild 
went through the roof — and often there simply were no workers to be found at any 
price — as a result.[lv]</p>

          <p>Decades of Republicans and rightwing media hammering on the argument that the crisis 
of the American middle class was caused by women and people of color has led to a near-
hysteria around US immigration policies, particularly around our southern border.</p>

          <p>Conservative talk-show host Lou Dobbs and others relentlessly amplified the message, 
encouraging Texas Governor Greg Abbott to intensify his war against border crossers. 
Abbott had the banks of the Rio Grande lined with miles of razor wire and installed a 
floating barrier in the river, endangering the lives of numerous migrants and asylum 
seekers. Abbott’s sadistic tactics have been linked to the drowning deaths of several 
migrants, including children.[lvi] White supremacist militias run “training operations” 
on the southern border, and white supremacist Republican politicians make regular 
pilgrimages there to stage photo-ops and press conferences about the supposed 
“invasion” of brown-skinned people.</p>

          <p>While it’s true — and a canard repeated ad infinitum on conservative media — that, for 
example, new home construction used to be a well-paid job that could lift a white 
worker into the middle class and that labor is now widely done by Hispanic immigrants, 
it’s not because of any kind of “invasion.” Instead, it’s because labor unions once 
prevented non-citizens from entry into their ranks and construction labor — once 
heavily unionized — was one of the industries hardest hit by Reagan’s war on organized 
labor.</p>

          <p>As Red states, one after the other, adopted so-called “right to work” laws (I call them 
“right to work for less” laws) contractors and other employers in those states shed 
their labor unions. With them went good pay and benefits, leaving what are essentially 
entry-level jobs that only recent immigrants are willing to do for the poor pay and 
lack of benefits now being offered.</p>

        The Right To Work For Less</h2>
        <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Right To Work For Less<br>
		    In 1935, Congress passed, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed, the 
			National Labor Relations Act, often referred to as the Wagner Act, 
			legalizing labor unions in the United States for the first time. It was 
			referred to as “the most radical piece of legislation ever passed by the 
			United States Congress.”[lvii] New York’s Democratic Senator Robert Wagner 
			was the new law’s main author, and his legislative aide, Simon H. 
			Rifkind, told Theodore J. St. Antoine in 1986 that there were several 
			reasons for the law.[lviii]</p>

          <p>First, there was considerable labor unrest across the nation; it had been 
		    particularly bloody over the preceding fifty or so years since the labor 
			movement first emerged in a big way in the 1880s. Employers would hire 
			private security companies or pay off local politicians and police to harass, 
			beat, and often even kill workers to prevent unionization.</p>
          <p>One of the most infamous examples was the Ludlow Massacre in 1914. After John D. 
Rockefeller expelled striking workers from his company town, they set up a tent city. 
Colorado National Guard troops were brought in and set up a machine gun on a bluff 
overlooking the site, then used it to strafe the tents. Women and children escaped to 
small crawlspace “basements” they’d dug under the tents, so the Guard soaked the tents 
with Rockefeller’s kerosene and lit them on fire, killing dozens of women and children.[lix]</p>

          <p>St. Antoine wrote that the goals, “of the Wagner Act were (1) to advance social justice 
and (2) to channel protest and defuse potential rebellion,” adding that, “it was 
essentially a ‘conservative’ measure.”[lx] He added that Senator Wagner thought it was 
high time America joined the rest of the developed world in offering union protections 
to workers, as unions were by that time widespread across the world, particularly in 
Europe.</p>

          <p>The social justice part of the equation had to do with lifting working people out of 
poverty and into the American Dream of what would become known over following decades 
as the middle class. The legislation established the right of workers to unionize a 
business and then require all of the company’s hourly workers to join or pay dues to 
the union.</p>

          <p>This “must join” provision is referred to as a “closed shop” (as opposed to an “open 
shop” where people are free to join or pay dues to unions or not). A third type of 
organization was called an “agency shop,” which is where employees can opt out of union 
membership but still must pay union dues, since the union incurs the costs of 
negotiating and enforcing contracts on behalf of all workers, whether they’re union 
members or not.</p>

          <p>In 1937, the US Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Wagner Act, cementing 
it into the American business and labor landscape.

This led to an explosion of union activity across the nation and the rapid emergence of 
an empowered working class. It also infuriated business owners and the Republican 
politicians they owned.</p>

          <p>Following World War II, the GOP had a major electoral victory in the election of 1946. 
Democrats had been solely in charge of the federal government from FDR’s 1932 election 
right up until that time, but in that election the GOP swept both the House and the 
Senate and held them for the following two years. Thus, in 1947, Republicans pushed 
through the notorious Taft-Hartley Act that allowed individual states to opt out of 
the closed shop provisions of the Wagner Act.</p>

          <p>President Harry Truman vetoed the bill, but Republicans mustered the votes to override 
his veto and the act stood and stands to this day. Since its passage, 28 Republican-
controlled states have chosen to opt out of Wagner Act provisions, driving the de-
unionization of America.</p>

          <p>They’ve done this while saying they’re simply allowing people in their states a “right 
to work.” That phrase was coined in its current meaning by Texas Republican operative 
and head of the Christian American Association, Vance Muse (1890-1950), who’d been an 
ardent opponent of unions, arguing that they would one day allow Black and Jewish people 
entry into industrial workplaces. It was quickly adopted by the GOP and is used to 
describe union-busting activity to this day.
Not everybody was fooled, though. As Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said in a 1961 speech:</p>

<blockquote>
“In our glorious fight for civil rights, we must guard against being fooled by false 
slogans, such as ‘right to work.’ It is a law to rob us of our civil rights and job 
rights. Its purpose is to destroy labor unions and the freedom of collective bargaining 
by which unions have improved wages and working conditions of everyone. Wherever these 
laws have been passed, wages are lower, job opportunities are fewer and there are no 
civil rights. We do not intend to let them do this to us. We demand this fraud be 
stopped. Our weapon is our vote.”
</blockquote>

          <p>King never lived to see the day that Taft-Hartley and “right to work for less” was 
overthrown and the American Dream could become more available to all working-class 
Americans; it still hasn’t happened, even though it’s been at the top of labor’s 
wish list for decades.</p>

          <p>How the American Dream of a middle class helps democracy
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) was created out of an 
earlier Europe-only group (that led, in part, to the European Union) in 1961. Its purpose 
stated purpose was to promote economic “progress” and trade among nations. Its member 
nations include most of the developed world, encompassing 1.4 billion people and 
representing fully 62.2 percent of nominal global GDP.</p>

          <p>Its first members included Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, West Germany, 
Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, 
Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States, with Japan, 
Finland, Australia, and New Zealand added in the 1970s.</p>

          <p>The OECD was formed out of an earlier neoliberal consensus that argued increasing 
unregulated trade among nations would inevitably lead to more democracy and a more 
robust middle class. Sadly, that belief has not panned out, as I explain in detail 
in The Hidden History of Neoliberalism.</p>

          <p>In 2019, the OECD completed a multi-year comprehensive analysis of the state of the 
economies and citizens of its country members. What they learned, following four decades 
of free trade, tax cuts on the rich, a dialing back of the welfare state, and 
significant deregulation of corporate and monopoly activity (these being the four 
“pillars” of neoliberalism) must have been disheartening to those still pushing these 
policies.</p>

          <p>Titled Under Pressure: The Squeezed Middle Class, the report was blunt in its findings. 
In its foreword, it pointed out that a middle class — the essence of the American Dream 
— is essential to sustain both a functioning economy and a democracy.[lxi]</p>
<blockquote>
“A strong and prosperous middle class,” its authors wrote, “is crucial for any successful 
economy and cohesive society. The middle class sustains consumption, it drives much of 
the investment in education, health, and housing and it plays a key role in supporting 
social protection systems through its tax contributions. Societies with a strong middle 
class have lower crime rates, they enjoy higher levels of trust and life satisfaction, 
as well as greater political stability and good governance.”
</blockquote>

<p>Sadly, they note without quite admitting it, their previous promotion of neoliberal 
policies has had an outcome quite different from their original goals:</p>

<blockquote>
 “However, current findings reveal that the top 10% in the income distribution holds 
 almost half of the total wealth, while the bottom 40% accounts for only 3%. The OECD 
 has also documented that economic insecurity concerns a large group of the population: 
 more than one in three people are economically vulnerable, meaning they lack the liquid 
 financial assets needed to maintain a living standard at the poverty level for at least 
 three months.”
</blockquote>

          <p>All in all, the statistics across the OECD — and particularly the trend lines — resemble 
those of the US over the years since the Reagan/Thatcher revolutions. The good news is 
that this has led the OECD to rethink their previous neoliberal policy proposals and 
advocacy, reinventing themselves for the 21st century:</p>

<blockquote>
“For its part, the OECD has called for a new growth narrative that puts people’s 
wellbeing at the centre. Its New Approaches to Economic Challenges and Inclusive 
Growth initiatives aim to upgrade the OECD’s analytical models and measurement 
tools, to better understand the functioning of our economies and promote policies 
that integrate considerations of equity ex-ante.”
</blockquote>

          <p>The state of the American Dream isn’t that different from what the OECD found across 
their member states, as virtually all have embraced, to greater or lesser degrees, the 
neoliberal policies promoted by Reagan and Thatcher in the 1980s. When Reagan came into 
office, for example, a bit over 60 percent of all income in the US went to middle class 
families; by 2020 that number had collapsed to 42 percent.[lxii] Meanwhile, the income 
of the top ten percent of Americans went from 29 percent in 1981 to over 50 percent 
today.[lxiii]</p>

          <p>As the Rand Corporation points out, this forty-year-long trend has hit families hard.</p>

<blockquote>
“Earnings have been flat or stagnant for many middle-class workers in the United States 
while health care, education, and housing costs are rising.”
</blockquote>

          <p>When Reagan was elected in 1980, healthcare costs were only 8.9 percent of GDP, in large 
part because almost every state required hospitals to be nonprofit and the drug 
marketplace was diversified and competitive.[lxiv] A large effort by the Reagan 
Revolution was to encourage states to drop that nonprofit requirement, and in 1983 
President Reagan directed his DOJ, FTC, and SEC to largely drop prosecutions for anti-
trust violations.</p>

          <p>When I grew up in Lansing, Michigan that state had a law requiring hospitals to be 
nonprofits: there were three nonprofit hospitals in town (Sparrow, St. Lawrence, and 
Ingham Medical). That law was repealed in 1980, so now all three are now for-profits.[lxv]</p>

          <p>As a result, today healthcare costs are nearly 20 percent of GDP (19.7% in 2020) and 
mark a significant drain on the income of both working people and the federal 
government.[lxvi]</p>

          <p>It’s the same story with education costs. Doing away with federal education support was 
a big part of Reagan’s agenda (he ended free college via the University of California 
system as governor in the 1970s) and, as a result, today America’s students and former 
students carry over $2 trillion in student loan debt.<sup>[lxvii]</sup></p>

          <p>And housing costs have also exploded, in large part because hedge funds and institutional 
and foreign investors have jumped into single-family residential housing as an investment 
have overwhelmed the market, particularly since the Bush Crash of 2008. As CNBC financial 
analyst Emmie Martin CFP noted in 2018: “Houses weren’t always this expensive. In 1940, 
the median home value in the U.S. was just $2,938. In 1980, it was $47,200, and by 2000, 
it had risen to $119,600. Even adjusted for inflation, the median home price in 1940 
would only have been $30,600 in 2000 dollars, according to data from the U.S. 
Census.”[lxviii] The median home price in 2022 was $390,000.</p>

          <p>When the middle class is buffeted by the winds of neoliberalism and the richest in 
America suck up most of the income and wealth, the impact isn’t only economic. People 
experiencing financial hardship often look beyond democracy to smooth-talking strongman 
types to “save” them. FDR pointing out that “necessitous men are not free men” is only 
part of the equation; necessitous men (and women) often stop seeking or valuing freedom, 
trading it away for what they believe will be financial security.</p>

          <p>As the OECD noted in the report mentioned earlier:</p>
<blockquote>
“The middle class champions political stability and good governance. It prevents 
political polarization and promotes greater compromise within government. Middle 
classes also provide a solid basis to build a democratic state, not only by financing 
it through taxes but also demanding regulations, enforcement of contracts and the rule 
of law.”

        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Why public schools are on the GOP’s hit list
The founders of our nation well understood the importance of universal quality public 
education. The first law mandating public schools paid for with taxpayer dollars was 
passed in Massachusetts in 1647: to this day, that state is notable for its historic 
emphasis on education.<sup>[lxix]</sup></p>

          <p>As Thomas Jefferson, who founded America’s first tuition-free public college (the 
University of Virginia), noted in a letter to Colonel Charles Yancey on January 6, 
1816:</p>

<blockquote>
“If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it expects 
what never was and never will be.”
</blockquote>

          <p>The American president who immediately preceded him, our second, John Adams, 
		    also weighed in on the importance of public education in a letter to his old 
			friend John Jebb when, in 1785, Adams was serving in London as America’s first 
			Minister to Great Britain. He’d seen the consequences of poverty and illiteracy 
			in both the US and England and was horrified:</p>

<blockquote>
“The social science will never be much improved, until the people unanimously know and 
consider themselves as the fountain of power, and until they shall know how to manage 
it wisely and honestly. Reformation must begin with the body of the people, which can 
be done only, to effect, in their educations.

“The whole people must take upon themselves the education of the whole people, and must 
be willing to bear the expenses of it. There should not be a district of one mile 
square, without a school in it, not founded by a charitable individual, but maintained 
at the expense of the people themselves.”<sup>[lxx]</sup>
</blockquote>
          <p>Nonetheless, former Tea Party congressman and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently 
put a bulls-eye on the back of the president of the 1.7 million-member American 
Federation of Teachers.</p>
<blockquote>
“I tell the story often — I get asked ‘Who’s the most dangerous person in the world? Is 
it Chairman Kim, is it Xi Jinping?’” Pompeo told Semafor’s Shelby Talcott.[lxxi]

“The most dangerous person in the world is Randi Weingarten. It’s not a close call. If 
you ask, ‘Who’s the most likely to take this republic down?’ It would be the teacher’s 
unions, and the filth that they’re teaching our kids…”
</blockquote>
          <p>Louise and I have known, respected, and admired Randi for years and she’s been a 
frequent guest on my program: her number one interest is providing the highest 
quality education to as many American children as possible. Full stop.</p>

          <p>So why would Pompeo, then pursuing the 2024 Republican nomination for president, 
risk triggering an American domestic terrorist to train his sites on her? Why would 
an educated man have such antipathy toward public school teachers?</p>

          <p>Public schools are on the GOP’s hit list, just as they were in Chile during the 
Pinochet regime, and for the same reasons:[lxxii]</p>

<dl>
  <dd>— Fascism flourishes when people are ignorant.</dd>

<dd>— Private for-profit schools are an efficient way to transfer billions from tax revenues 
into the coffers of “education entrepreneurs” who then recycle that money into 
Republican political campaigns (just like they’ve done with private for-profit 
prisons).</dd>

<dd>— Private schools are most likely to be segregated by race and class, which appeals 
to the bigoted base of the Republican party.</dd>

<dd>— Most public school teachers are unionized, and the GOP hates unions.</dd>

<dd>— While public school boards are our most basic and vigorous form of democracy, 
private schools are generally unaccountable to the public.</dd>

<dd>— Whitewashing America’s racial and genocidal history while ignoring the struggles 
of women and queer folk further empowers straight white male supremacy.</dd>

<dd>— Nothing inspires fear and terror in the minds of parents than a threat to their 
children, and the GOP — being totally committed to enriching the rich and 
impoverishing everybody else — has nothing else to sell than fear and hate to win 
elections. (See item #1: fascism.)</dd>
</dl>

<p>Author Umberto Eco, who had a ringside seat to the rise of Italian dictator Benito 
Mussolini in the 1920s, noted in his “14 indicators of fascism” that dumbing down the 
populace by lowering educational standards was critical to producing a compliant 
populace a fascist leader could easily manipulate.</p>

<blockquote>
“All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks,” he wrote, “made use of an impoverished vocabulary, 
and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical 
reasoning.”[lxxiii]
</blockquote>

<p>Ironically, this very use of public schools to promote a political agenda was the 
foundation David Koch cited when, in 1980, the billionaire conservative activist 
attacked American public schools during his run for Vice President on the Libertarian 
Party ticket.</p>

<blockquote>
“We condemn compulsory education laws … and we call for the immediate repeal of such 
laws,” proclaimed his platform. “We advocate the complete separation of education and 
State. Government schools lead to the indoctrination of children and interfere with 
the free choice of individuals. Government ownership, operation, regulation, and 
subsidy of schools and colleges should be ended.”[lxxiv]
</blockquote>

<p>But the United States spends almost a trillion dollars a year on primary school education, 
an expense category just below healthcare and even more than the Pentagon budget: there 
are massive profits to be made if privatized entities can skim even a few percent off 
the top.[lxxv]</p>

<p>Those profits, in turn, can be used — with the Supreme Court’s blessing — to legally 
bribe elected officials to further gut public schools and transfer even more of our 
tax dollars to private schools and their stockholders.</p>

<p>This pursuit of America’s education dollars is nothing new. The first American president 
to put an anti-public-schools crusader in charge of the Education Department was Ronald 
Reagan.</p>

<p>At the time, our public schools were the envy of the world and had recently raised up a 
generation of scientists and innovators that brought us everything from the transistor 
to Velcro to putting men on the moon.</p>

<p>Reagan’s Education Secretary Bill Bennett is probably most famous for having claimed 
that, “You could abort every Black baby in this country, and your crime rate would go 
down.” And then aggressively standing behind his quote in repeated media 
appearances.[lxxvi] [lxxvii]</p>

<p>Reagan and Bennett oversaw the gutting of Federal support for civics education, cutting 
the nation’s federal education budget by 18.5%.</p>

<p>As a result, the group that runs national exams of eighth graders across the country, 
the National Assessment of Educational Progress, determined in 2018 that only 24% of 
US students were “proficient in civics.”[lxxviii] It’s gotten so bad that the Lincoln 
Project, a pro-democracy PAC, is launching a K-12 civics program of their own called 
the Franklin Project.[lxxix]</p>

<p>George W. Bush continued the GOP tradition, proposing an 8% cut to education and 
welfare budgets.[lxxx]</p>

<p>After initiating the privatization of Medicare in 2003 with the Medicare Advantage 
scam (a model for privatizing education), his Education Secretary, Rod Paige, called 
the nation’s largest teacher’s union, the National Education Association, a “terrorist 
organization.”[lxxxi]</p>

<p>Sixteen years later, Donald Trump and his Education Secretary Betsy DeVos then proposed 
cutting 12% or $8.5 billion out of the federal education budget, while allocating over 
$5 billion in taxpayer dollars to flow into the money bins of their private school 
cronies.[lxxxii]</p>

<p>I mentioned Pompeo’s essentially calling Randi Weingarten a terrorist. Unions as 
saboteurs is a viewpoint widely held across the Republican Party and among 
rightwing billionaires.</p>

<p>But it’s simply not true: teachers’ unions have been a primary force in improving the 
quality of American education for almost a century.</p>

<p>Eunice S. Han is an economics professor and researcher at the University of Utah, and 
formerly was with Wellesley College. She did exhaustive research into the impact of 
teachers’ unions on teacher quality and educational outcomes: it’s the single-most 
definitive study done on the subject to date.[lxxxiii]</p>

<p>Her findings were unambiguous and rebut the GOP’s talking point that teachers’ unions 
“protect bad teachers”:</p>

<blockquote>
“[T]eachers unions, by negotiating higher wages for teachers, lower the quit probability 
of high-ability teachers but raise the dismissal rate of underperforming teachers, as 
higher wages provide districts greater incentive to select better teachers.”[lxxxiv]
</blockquote>

<p>Looking at the most comprehensive set of national data available on teacher quality 
and educational outcome from “the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES): 
the School and Staffing Survey (SASS) for three waves (2003-2004, 2007- 2008, and 
2011-2012), its supplement Teacher Follow-up Survey (TFS) for each wave of the SASS, 
and the School Districts Finance Survey (SDFS),” she found:</p>

<blockquote>
“The data confirms that, compared to districts with weak unionism, districts with strong 
unionism dismiss more low-quality teachers and retain more high-quality teachers. The 
empirical analysis shows that this dynamic of teacher turnover in highly unionized 
districts raises average teacher quality and improves student achievement.”[lxxxv]
</blockquote>

<p>But don’t bother trying to tell that to Republicans: they know that unions are 
terrorists, or at least give nightmares to bad bosses and poorly run businesses that 
exploit their workers. As Betsy DeVos told an ALEC meeting of Republican state 
legislators and corporate lobbyists in July, 2017:</p>

<blockquote>
“They’ve made it clear that they care more about a system, one created in the 1800s, 
than they do about individual students.”[lxxxvi]
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, “Don’t bother me with facts.”</p>

<p>John Adams and Thomas Jefferson were right about public education, and privatizing it 
is as much a crime against the commons and our democracy as was privatizing our 
prisons, over half the Pentagon budget, and Medicare.</p>

<p>Rightwing billionaires are now funding Astroturf “Liberty” and “Freedom” groups to 
attack and take over public school boards, seeking to ghettoize their schools, drive 
out unionized teachers, and impose a gender-bigoted, white supremacist, and anti-
science curriculum. (Only 40% of our schools today even teach evolution, as that’s 
become so “controversial” again.)[lxxxvii]</p>

<p>Of all our democratic institutions, from Congress to state houses to city councils, 
the most on-the-ground, closest-to-the-people are school boards.</p>

<p>They’re the most vibrant and often most important of our governmental bodies, designed 
to express and facilitate the will of local parents and voters. And a great springboard 
to other elected offices: many members of Congress began their political careers running 
for a school board.</p>

<p>Private schools, of course, don’t have school boards. They’re accountable to their 
shareholders and CEOs.</p>

<p>Steve Bannon and other rightwing personalities have, for the past several years as part 
of their effort to destroy public education, been aggressively encouraging their 
followers to run for public school boards and, where they don’t win, show up at 
every meeting to make their members lives miserable.</p>

<p>It’s an area where Democrats and progressives have dropped the ball, big time.</p>

<p>If you’re a parent or grandparent, or even just a concerned citizen, there is no 
better or more crucial time to show up at your local school board than now. And 
bring your friends and neighbors with you.</p>

          Student debt harms the American Dream</h2>
        <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter"></p>Taiwan and Japan — island nations with few natural resources that have both used the 
brainpower of their people to become among the richest in the world — demonstrate the 
importance of a nation having a large number of well-educated citizens. Don’t tell 
that to the GOP, though.</p>

          <p>In early 2023, six Republicans on the Supreme Court killed President Biden’s student 
loan debt forgiveness program.</p>

          <p>Republicans, predictably, were giddy, celebrating another Supreme Court victory in 
which, on behalf of their billionaire owners, they were again “owning the libs.”</p>

          <p>They’re ecstatic that poor and working class people — particularly Black women who, as 
ABC News noted, “hold nearly two-thirds of the nearly $2 trillion outstanding student 
debt in the U.S.” — will find it ever harder to climb into the middle class, which 
increasingly requires a college degree.[lxxxviii] [lxxxix]</p>

          <p>When you search on the phrase “student debt forgiveness” one of the top hits that 
comes up is a Fox “News” article by a woman who paid off her loans in full.</p>

<blockquote>
“There are millions of Americans like me,” the author writes, “for whom debt 
forgiveness is an infuriating slap in the face after years of hard work and 
sacrifice. Those used to be qualities we encouraged as an American culture, 
and if Biden gets his way, we’ll be sending a very different message to the 
next generation.”
</blockquote>
          <p>This is, to be charitable, bullsh*t.</p>
          <p>Forgiving student debt is not a slap at anybody; it’s righting a moral wrong 
inflicted on millions of Americans by Ronald Reagan and his morbidly rich 
Republican buddies.</p>

          <p>Student debt is evil.</p>

          <p>It’s a crime against our nation, hobbling opportunity and weakening our 
intellectual infrastructure. It maintains and in many cases rigidifies the 
racial and class caste systems today’s Americans inherited from our eras 
of slavery and indenture.</p>

          <p>Combine this decision with the six Republicans on the Court ending affirmative 
action and legalizing discrimination this term and it’s clear this is exactly 
what the rightwing billionaires who put them on the Court and support their 
lavish vacations and lifestyles want.</p>
          <p>Many, if not most, of the people in today’s billionaire class have supported — 
and fought for — such a caste system since the founding of America, and in every 
other country around the world, since time immemorial. It’s the history of western 
civilization from ancient Greece and Rome, the stories of kings and conquistadors, 
and the “Robber Barons” of America’s gilded age.</p>

          <p>They really don’t care about improving the lives of everyday Americans; their 
philosophy is, “I got mine; screw you.” Educated themselves, they’ve always 
worked to “pull up the ladder” behind them and thus maintain their elite status.</p>

          <p>As history shows, this harms countries in real and measurable ways.</p>

          <p>Every nation’s single biggest long-term asset is a well-educated populace, and 
student debt diminishes that.</p>

          <p>Every other advanced democracy on the planet understands this.</p>

          <p>Student debt at the scale we have in America does not exist anywhere else in the 
rest of the developed world.</p>

          <p>American students, in fact, are going to college for free right now in Germany, 
Iceland, France, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Slovenia, and the Czech Republic, 
because pretty much anybody can go to college for free in those countries and 
dozens of others.[xc]</p>

<blockquote>
“Student debt?” The rest of the developed world doesn’t know what you’re talking about.
</blockquote>

          <p>Student debt also largely didn’t exist in modern America before the Reagan Revolution. 
It was created by Republicans here in the 1980s — intentionally — and, if we can 
overcome Republican opposition, we can intentionally end it here and join the rest 
of the world in once again benefiting from an educated populace.</p>

          <p>Forty years on from the Reagan Revolution, student debt has crippled three generations 
of young Americans: over 44 million people carry the burden, totaling a $2+ trillion 
drag on our economy that benefits nobody except the banks earning interest on the debt 
and the politicians they pay off.[xci]</p>

          <p>But that doesn’t begin to describe the damage student debt has done to America since 
Reagan, in his first year as governor of California, ended free tuition at the 
University of California and cut state aid to that college system by 20 percent 
across-the-board.</p>

          <p>After having destroyed low income Californians’ ability to get a college education 
in the 1970s, Reagan then took his anti-education program national as president in 1981.</p>

          <p>When asked why he’d taken a meat-axe to higher education and was pricing college 
out of the reach of most Americans, he said that college students were “too liberal” 
and America “should not subsidize intellectual curiosity.”[xcii]</p>

          <p>It was the 1980s version of today’s “war on woke.” And, like now, much of the right’s 
“war” was directed against students.</p>

          <p>On May 1, 1970, Governor Reagan announced that students protesting the Vietnam war 
across America were “brats,” “freaks” and “cowardly fascists,” adding, as The New 
York Times noted at the time:</p>

<blockquote>
“If it takes a bloodbath, let’s get it over with. No more appeasement!”[xciii]
</blockquote>

          <p>Four days later four were dead at Kent State, having been murdered by national guard 
riflemen using live ammunition against anti-war protesters.</p>

          <p>Before Reagan became president, states paid 65 percent of the costs of colleges, and 
federal aid covered another 15 or so percent, leaving students to cover the remaining 
20 percent with their tuition payments.[xciv]</p>

          <p>When I briefly attended college in the late 1960s — before Reagan — I could pay my 
tuition working a weekend job as a DJ at a local radio station and washing dishes at 
Bob’s Big Boy restaurant on Trowbridge Road in East Lansing.</p>

          <p>That’s how it works — at a minimum — in most developed nations, although in many 
northern European countries college is not only free, but the government pays 
students a stipend to cover books and rent.</p>

          <p>Here in America, though, the numbers are pretty much reversed from pre-1980 as a 
result of Reaganommics, with students now covering about 80 percent of the costs. 
Thus the need for student loans here in the USA.[xcv]</p>

          <p>As soon as he became president, Reagan went after federal aid to students with a 
fanatic fervor. Devin Fergus documented for The Washington Post how, as a result, 
student debt first became a thing across the United States during the early ’80s:</p>

<blockquote>
“No federal program suffered deeper cuts than student aid. Spending on higher 
education was slashed by some 25 percent between 1980 and 1985. ... Students 
eligible for grant assistance freshmen year had to take out student loans to 
cover their second year.”[xcvi]
</blockquote>

          <p>It became a mantra for conservatives, particularly in Reagan’s cabinet. Let the 
kids pay for their own damn “liberal” educations.</p>

          <p>Reagan’s college educated Director of the Office of Management and Budget, David 
Stockman, told a reporter in 1981:</p>

<blockquote>
“I don’t accept the notion that the federal government has an obligation to fund 
generous grants to anybody who wants to go to college. It seems to me that if people 
want to go to college bad enough then there is opportunity and responsibility on their 
part to finance their way through the best way they can. … I would suggest that we 
could probably cut it a lot more.”[xcvii]
</blockquote>

          <p>After all, cutting taxes for the morbidly rich was Reagan’s first and main priority, 
a position the GOP holds to this day. Cutting education could “reduce the cost of 
government” and thus justify more tax cuts.</p>

          <p>Reagan’s first Education Secretary, Terrel Bell, wrote in his memoir:</p>

<blockquote>
“Stockman and all the true believers identified all the drag and drain on the 
economy with the ‘tax-eaters’: people on welfare, those drawing unemployment 
insurance, students on loans and grants, the elderly bleeding the public purse 
with Medicare, the poor exploiting Medicaid.”[xcviii]
</blockquote>

          <p>These doctrines became an article of faith across the GOP and remain so to this 
day, as we saw with the Republicans on the Supreme Court ending affirmative action.</p>

          <p>Reagan’s OMB Director David Stockman told Congress that students were “tax eaters 
… [and] a drain and drag on the American economy.” Student aid, he said, “isn’t a 
proper obligation of the taxpayer.”[xcix]</p>

          <p>This was where, when, and how today’s student debt crisis was kicked off in 1981. 
Before Reagan, though, America had a different perspective.</p>

          <p>Both my father and my wife Louise’s father served in the military during World War 
II and both went to college on the GI Bill. My dad dropped out after two years and 
went to work in a steel plant because mom got pregnant with me; Louise’s dad, who’d 
grown up dirt poor, went all the way for his law degree and ended up as Assistant 
Attorney General for the State of Michigan.</p>

          <p>They were two among almost 8 million young men and women who not only got free tuition 
from the 1944 GI Bill but also received a stipend to pay for room, board, and books. 
And the result — the return on our government’s investment in those 8 million educations 
— was substantial.[c]</p>

          <p>The best book on that time and subject is Edward Humes’ Over Here: How the GI Bill 
Transformed the American Dream[ci], summarized by Mary Paulsell for the Columbia 
Daily Tribune:</p>

<blockquote>
“[That] groundbreaking legislation gave our nation 14 Nobel Prize winners, three 
Supreme Court justices, three presidents, 12 senators, 24 Pulitzer Prize winners, 
238,000 teachers, 91,000 scientists, 67,000 doctors, 450,000 engineers, 240,000 
accountants, 17,000 journalists, 22,000 dentists and millions of lawyers, nurses, 
artists, actors, writers, pilots and entrepreneurs.”[cii]
</blockquote>

          <p>Free education literally built America’s middle class.</p>

          <p>When people have an education, they not only raise the competence and vitality of a 
nation; they also earn more money, which stimulates the economy. Because they earn 
more, they pay more in taxes, which helps pay back the government for the cost of 
that education.</p>

          <p>In 1952 dollars, the GI Bill’s educational benefit cost the nation $7 billion. The 
increased economic output over the next 40 years that could be traced directly to 
that educational cost was $35.6 billion, and the extra taxes received from those 
higher-wage-earners was $12.8 billion.</p>

          <p>In other words, the US government invested $7 billion and got a $48.4 billion return 
on that investment, about a $7 return for every $1 invested.[ciii]</p>

          <p>In addition, that educated workforce made it possible for America to lead the world 
in innovation, R&D, and new business development for three generations.</p>

          <p>We invented the transistor, the integrated circuit, the internet, new generations of 
miracle drugs, sent men to the moon and reshaped science.</p>

          <p>Presidents Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln knew this simple concept that seems 
so hard for Reagan and generations of Republicans since to understand: when you invest 
in young people, you’re investing in your nation.</p>

          <p>Jefferson founded the University of Virginia as a 100% tuition-free school; it was one 
of his three proudest achievements, ranking higher on the epitaph he wrote for his own 
tombstone than his having been both president and vice president.[civ]</p>

          <p>Lincoln was equally proud of the free and low-tuition colleges he started. As the state 
of North Dakota notes:</p>

<blockquote>
“Lincoln signed the Morrill Act on July 2, 1862, giving each state a minimum of 90,000 
acres of land to sell, to establish colleges of engineering, agriculture, and military 
science. … Proceeds from the sale of these lands were to be invested in a perpetual 
endowment fund which would provide support for colleges of agriculture and mechanical 
arts in each of the states.”[cv]
</blockquote>

          <p>Fully 76 free or very-low-tuition state colleges were started because of Lincoln’s effort 
and since have educated millions of Americans including my mom, who graduated from land-
grant Michigan State University in the 1940s, having easily paid her minimal tuition 
working as a summer lifeguard in her home town of Charlevoix, Michigan.[cvi]</p>

          <p>Republican policies of starving education and cranking up student debt have made US 
banks a lot of money, but they’ve cut America’s scientific leadership in the world 
and, since the institution of trickle-down Reaganomics, stopped three generations of 
young people from starting businesses, having families, and buying homes.</p>

          <p>So, if we want to revive the American Dream, we must eliminate student debt in the 
United States, just as most other developed nations across the world have already done.</p>

        Housing should not be a commodity</h2>
        <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">The American Dream of owning your own home is the opposite of homelessness: housing 
is one of the primary essentials of life. A functioning society requires sufficient 
affordable housing, something that is more and more slipping away from Americans 
every day.</p>

          <p>It seems that everywhere you look in America you see the tragedy of homelessness. 
Rarely, though, do you hear that Wall Street is helping cause it.</p>

          <p>Thirty-two percent seems to be the magic threshold, according to new research funded 
by the real estate listing company Zillow.[cvii] When neighborhoods hit rent rates 
in excess of 32 percent of neighborhood income, homelessness explodes. And we’re 
seeing it play out right in front of us in cities across America because a handful 
of Wall Street billionaires want to make a killing.</p>

          <p>Housing prices have gone out of control since my dad bought his house in 1957 
when I was six years old. He got a Veteran’s Administration-subsidized loan and 
picked up the brand-new 3-bedroom ranch house my brothers and I grew up in, in 
suburban south Lansing, Michigan. It cost him $13,000, which was about twice what 
he made every year working a good union job in a tool-and-die shop.</p>

          <p>As mentioned earlier, when my dad bought his home in the 1950s the median price of 
a single-family house was around 2.2 times the median American family income.[cviii] 
Today, the Fed says, the median house sells for $374,900 while the median American 
income is $35,805 — a ratio of more than ten-to-one between housing costs and annual 
income.[cix] [cx]</p>

          <p>As the Zillow study notes, “Across the country, the rent burden already exceeds the 
32 percent [of median income] threshold in 100 of the 386 markets included in this 
analysis….”[cxi]</p>

          <p>And wherever housing prices become more than three times annual income, homelessness 
stalks like the grim reaper.</p>

          <p>We’re told that America’s cities have seen this increase in housing costs since 
the 1950s in some part because of the growing wealth and population of this 
country.[cxii] There were, after all, 168 million people in the US the year my 
dad bought his house; today there are 330 million.[cxiii]</p>

          <p>And it’s true that we haven’t been building enough new housing, particularly low 
income housing, as 40 years of Reaganism have driven down wages and income for 
working class people relative to all of their expenses.</p>

          <p>But that’s not what’s been uniquely driving housing prices into the stratosphere — 
and, as a consequence, the crisis in homelessness — over the past decade. You can 
thank speculation for much of that.</p>

          <p>As the Zillow-funded study noted: “This research demonstrates that the homeless 
population climbs faster when rent affordability — the share of income people 
spend on rent — crosses certain thresholds. In many areas beyond those thresholds, 
even modest rent increases can push thousands more Americans into homelessness.”</p>

          <p>So how did we get here?</p>

          <p>It started with a wave of foreign buyers over the past 30 years (particularly from 
China, Canada, Mexico, India and Colombia) who, just last year, picked up over 
154,000 homes as their way of parking money in America.[cxiv]</p>

          <p>As Marketwatch noted in a 2015 article titled The Danger of Foreign Buyers Gobbling 
Up American Homes”: “Unusual high appreciation of the aforementioned urban centers 
is due to the ever-growing influx of foreign buyers — mostly wealthy Chinese — who 
view American residential real estate as the safest investment commodity. … According 
to a National Realtors Association survey, the Chinese spent $22 billion on U.S. 
housing in 12 months through March 2014…. [Other foreign buyers include primarily 
include] Canadians, British, Indians and Mexicans.”[cxv]</p>

          <p>But foreign investment has been down for the past few years; what’s taken 
over and is really driving home prices today are massive, multi-billion-dollar 
funds that sweep into neighborhoods and buy everything available, bidding against 
families and driving up housing prices.</p>

          <p>As noted in a Wall Street Journal article titled “Meet Your New Landlord: Wall 
Street,” in just one suburb (Spring Hill) of Nashville, “In all of Spring Hill, 
four firms … own nearly 700 houses … [which] amounts to about 5% of all the 
houses in town.”[cxvi]</p>

          <p>This is the tiniest tip of the iceberg.</p>

<blockquote>
“On the first Tuesday of each month,” notes the Journal article about a similar 
phenomenon in Atlanta, investors “toted duffels stuffed with millions of dollars in 
cashier’s checks made out in various denominations so they wouldn’t have to interrupt 
their buying spree with trips to the bank…”[cxvii]
</blockquote>

          <p>The same thing is happening in cities and suburbs all across America; the investment 
goliaths use fine-tuned computer algorithms to sniff out houses they can turn into 
rental properties, making over-market and unbeatable cash bids often within minutes 
of a house hitting the market.</p>

          <p>After stripping neighborhoods of homes families can buy, they then begin raising 
rents as far as the market will bear.</p>

          <p>In the Nashville suburb of Spring Hill, the vice-mayor, Bruce Hull, told the Journal 
you used to be able to rent “a three bedroom, two bath house for $1,000 a month.” 
Today, the Journal notes, “The average rent for 148 single-family homes in Spring 
Hill owned by the big four [Wall Street investor] landlords was about $1,773 a 
month…”[cxviii]</p>

          <p>Ryan Dezember, in his book Underwater: How Our American Dream of Homeownership Became 
a Nightmare, describes the story of a family trying to buy a home in Phoenix. Every 
time they entered a bid, they were outbid instantly, the price rising over and over, 
until finally the family’s father threw in the towel.[cxix]</p>

<blockquote>
“Jacobs was bewildered,” writes Dezember. “Who was this aggressive bidder?”
</blockquote>

          <p>Turns out it was Blackstone Group, now the world’s largest real estate investor. At 
the time they were buying $150 million worth of American houses every week, trying 
to spend over $10 billion. And that’s just a drop in the overall bucket.</p>

          <p>In 2018, corporations bought 1 out of every 10 homes sold in America, according to 
Dezember, noting that, “Between 2006 and 2016, when the homeownership rate fell to 
its lowest level in fifty years, the number of renters grew by about a quarter.”</p>

          <p>This all really took off around a decade ago, when Morgan Stanley published a 2011 
report titled “The Rentership Society,” arguing that snapping up houses and renting 
them back to people who otherwise would have wanted to buy them could be the newest 
and hottest investment opportunity for Wall Street’s billionaires and their funds.[cxx]</p>

          <p>Turns out, Morgan Stanley was right. Warren Buffett, KKR and The Carlyle Group have 
all jumped into residential real estate, along with hundreds of smaller investment 
groups, and the National Home Rental Council has emerged as the industry’s premiere 
lobbying group, working to block rent control legislation and other efforts to 
control the industry.[cxxi]</p>

          <p>As John Husing, the owner of Economics and Politics Inc., told The Tennessean 
newspaper, “What you have are neighborhoods that are essentially unregulated 
apartment houses. It could be disastrous for the city.”[cxxii]</p>

          <p>Meanwhile, as unionization levels here remain among the lowest in the developed 
world, Reagan’s ongoing war on working people continues to wipe out America’s families.</p>

          <p>At the same time that housing prices, both to purchase and to rent, are being driven 
through the roof by foreign and Wall Street investors, a new survey published this 
month by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard TH Chan School of 
Public Health found that American families are in crisis. Their study found:</p>

<blockquote>
“Thirty-eight percent (38%) of [all] households across the nation report facing 
serious financial problems in the past few months.

“There is a sharp income divide in serious financial problems, as 59% of those with 
annual incomes below $50,000 report facing serious financial problems in the past 
few months, compared with 18% of households with annual incomes of $50,000 or more.

“These serious financial problems are cited despite 67% of households reporting 
that in the past few months, they have received financial assistance from the government.

“Another significant problem for many U.S. households is losing their savings during 
the COVID-19 outbreak. Nineteen percent (19%) of U.S. households report losing all of 
their savings during the COVID-19 outbreak and not currently having any savings to 
fall back on.

“At the time the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) eviction ban 
expired, 27% of renters nationally reported serious problems paying their rent 
in the past few months.”[cxxiii]
</blockquote>

          <p>These are not separate issues, and they are driving an explosion in homelessness. 
The Zillow study found:</p>

<blockquote>
“Communities where people spend more than 32 percent of their income on rent can 
expect a more rapid increase in homelessness.

“Income growth has not kept pace with rents, leading to an affordability crunch 
with cascading effects that, for people on the bottom economic rung, increases the 
risk of homelessness.

“The areas that are most vulnerable to rising rents, unaffordability and poverty 
hold 15 percent of the U.S. population — and 47 percent of people experiencing 
homelessness.”[cxxiv]
</blockquote>

          <p>The Zillow study makes grim reading and is worth checking out. In community after 
community, when rent prices exceed 32 percent of median home income, homelessness 
explodes. It’s measurable, predictable, and is destroying what’s left of the 
American working class, particularly minorities.</p>

          <p>The loss of affordable homes also locks otherwise middle class families out of 
the traditional way wealth is accumulated — through home ownership: over 61% of 
all American middle-income family wealth is their home’s equity.[cxxv] And as 
families are priced out of ownership and forced to rent, they become more vulnerable 
to homelessness.</p>

          <p>Housing is one of the primary essentials of life. Nobody in America should be without 
it, and for society to work, housing costs must track incomes in a way that makes 
housing both available and affordable.</p>

          <p>If ever there was a time to solve to this problem — and regulate corporate and 
foreign investment in American single-family housing — it’s now.</p>

        The impact of tax policy on the American Dream</h2>
        <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">The maintenance and growth of a middle class depends on wages rising over time, both to keep up with inflation and to steadily improve the lot of working people, as America saw between 1933 and 1981. But working-class wages have been steadily declining ever since the Reagan Revolution, and it can’t entirely be attributed to the GOP’s war on organized 
		  labor.</p>

          <p>It turns out that income taxes are another way conservative and neoliberal policies have taken a chunk out of the income and wealth of working people, but not in the way you probably think.</p>

          <p>In fact, income taxes affect working class people in a completely different way than they impact the morbidly rich. It all boils down to two simple principles, which are — unfortunately — a mystery to most Americans and ignored political and media discussions of income taxes.</p>

          <p>— Cutting high-end income taxes makes rich people richer and raises a nation’s debt but does nothing else. Nothing. It doesn’t influence their pay or lifestyle in any measurable way, nor does it stimulate economic growth. And because tax cuts on the morbidly rich have to be paid for by increasing the national debt, they’re actually a drag on the economy.</p>

          <p>— The effect is quite opposite for working class people. Cutting income taxes on them causes their pay to go down or remain flat. The experience of 100+ years in the United States and nations around the world also finds that raising taxes on working class people leads, over time, to pay raises, something no politician since FDR has had the courage to explain, while cutting their taxes leads to pay cuts.[cxxvi]</p>

<blockquote>
“Wait a minute!” I can hear you saying. “Cutting taxes on rich people makes them richer, but cutting taxes on working class people makes them poorer? WTF?!?” Here’s how it works with a short story thrown in.
</blockquote>

          <p>Some years ago, I did my radio program for a week from the studios of Danish Radio in Copenhagen.</p>

          <p>Speaking with one of the more conservative members of Parliament, I asked why the Danish people didn’t revolt over an average 52% income tax rate on working people, with an even higher rate on really high earners?</p>

          <p>He pointed out to me that the average Dane was doing just fine, with a minimum wage that averaged about $18 an hour, free college and free healthcare, not to mention four weeks of paid vacation every year and notoriety as the happiest nation on earth, according to a study done by the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom.</p>

<blockquote>
“You Americans are such suckers,” he told me and I reported some years ago.[cxxvii] “You think the rules for taxes that apply to rich people also apply to working people, but they don’t.

“When working people’s taxes go up,” he said, “their pay also goes up over time. When their taxes go down, their pay goes down. It may take a year or two or three to all even out, but it always works that way — look at any country in Europe. And that rule on taxes is the exact opposite of how it works for rich people!”[cxxviii]
</blockquote>

          <p>Economist David Ricardo explained this in 1817 with his “Iron Law of Wages,” laid out in his book On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation.[cxxix]</p>

          <p>Ricardo pointed out that in the working class “labor marketplace,” before-tax income is pretty much irrelevant. The money people live on, the money that defines the “marketplace for labor,” is after-tax take-home pay.</p>

          <p>But the rules for how taxes work are completely different for rich people.</p>

          <p>When taxes go down on rich people, they simply keep the money that they saved with the tax cut. They use it to stuff larger wads of cash into their money bins.</p>

          <p>When taxes go up on them, they’ll just raise their own wages — until they hit a confiscatory tax rate (which hasn’t existed since the Reagan Revolution), and then they’ll stop giving themselves raises and leave the money in their company.</p>

          <p>And, history shows, while keeping that money in their company to avoid a high top tax bracket, employers typically pay their workers more over time as well.</p>

          <p>In other words, as taxes go up, income typically goes up for working class people but goes down for the very rich: High tax brackets discourage exploitation by the very rich and push up wages for working class people.</p>

          <p>We saw this throughout the 1940–1980 period; income at the very tip-top was stable at about 30 times worker’s wages because rich people didn’t want to get pushed into that very tip-top tax bracket of 74%.</p>

          <p>But for working class people, Ricardo pointed out 200 years ago, the rules are completely different.</p>

          <p>When working class people end up with more after-tax money as a consequence of a tax cut, their employers realize that they’re receiving more than the “market for labor” would dictate.</p>

          <p>And over time the “Iron Law” dictates that employers will cut back those wages when working class people get a tax cut.</p>

          <p>For example, if the average worker on an automobile assembly line made $30,000 a year in after-tax take-home pay, all the car manufacturing companies know that $30K in their pockets is what people will build cars for. It’s the set-point in the “market for labor” for that industry or type of job.</p>

          <p>Because of income taxes, both federal, state and local, an auto worker may need a gross, pre-tax income of $40,000 a year to end up with that $30,000 take-home pay, so that $40,000 gross (before-tax) income becomes the average pay across the industry. At that pay and tax rate, workers end up taking home $30,000 a year.</p>

          <p>But what happens if that income tax for working-class people is cut in half?</p>

          <p>Now, a $40,000 a year autoworker’s salary produces $35,000 a year in take-home pay, and employers in the auto industry know that that’s $5000 a year more than they have to pay to hire new people to build cars.</p>

          <p>Put another way, the employers know that they can hire people in the labor market for $30,000 a year take-home pay, which is now a gross salary of $35,000, so they begin lowering their $40,000 gross wage offerings toward $35,000 to make up for the tax cut and keep take-home pay within the $30,000 “market for wages.”</p>

          <p>Since Reagan‘s massive tax cut, we’ve seen this very phenomenon in the auto industry itself! As taxes went down, pay has been more than cut in half for new hires.[cxxx]</p>

          <p>In other words, income tax cuts don’t increase the take-home pay of working people who have little control over their salaries. It’s the opposite, in fact.</p>

          <p>On the other hand, when income taxes on working people increase, employers have to raise working class wages so their workers’ take-home pay stays the same. And that’s exactly what happened in the period from the 1940s to the 1980s as tax rates were fairly high across the board.</p>

          <p>But when income taxes on working people go down, employers will reduce the wages they offer over time to keep their workers’ take-home pay at the same level. That, after all, is what Ricardo’s “market for labor” specifies.</p>

          <p>But the rules are completely different for the rich, who live outside the “Iron Law of Labor.”</p>

          <p>When taxes change for the very rich, they take home less money when taxes go up and keep more money when taxes go down. It’s the opposite of what happens to working-class people.</p>

          <p>The incredible magic trick that the morbidly rich have done in America over the past 40 years is to convince average working people that the tax rules for the rich also apply to working class people, and therefore tax cuts like those given billionaires by Reagan, Bush, and Trump benefit average workers, too.</p>

          <p>Economist have known since the early 1800s that this is nonsense, as David Ricardo and many others have pointed out.</p>

          <p>But after decades of this “you should worry about tax increases the same way rich people do” message being pounded into our brains by Republican politicians, working people think that tax cuts benefit them and tax increases hurt them.</p>

          <p>It’s a real testimonial to the power of the Republican propaganda machine that even though individual wages have been flat or even declining in many industries for the past 40 years because of Republican tax cuts, the average American still thinks tax cuts are a good thing for them.</p>

          <p>In fact, the time of greatest prosperity for the working class, when working class take-home pay (and wealth) was increasing faster than the income (and wealth) of the top 1%, was the period from 1940 to 1980 when taxes were high and the nation was prosperous.[cxxxi]</p>

          <p>FDR raised the top tax bracket to 91% and it stayed there through his administration, as well as those of Truman, Eisenhower, JFK and the early years of LBJ. President Johnson dropped it to 74%, which held through his administration as well as those of Nixon, Ford and Carter.</p>

          <p>This was the time of maximum American working class prosperity.</p>

          <p>Reagan’s massive tax cuts in the 1980s, of course, put an end to that and started the explosion of wealth at the top which has led America to produce over 700 billionaires today. And gutted America’s ability to maintain first-class infrastructure.</p>

          <p>To stabilize our economy and re-empower working people, we must bring back the top tax bracket that existed before the Reagan Revolution. It’ll also provide the necessary funds to rebuild our country from the wreckage of Reagan’s neoliberal policies, which are largely still in place.</p>

          <p>By taxing income in the very top brackets at a rate well above 50%, ideally the 74% rate we had before Reagan, we stabilize the economy, stop the relentless poaching of working peoples’ wages for the money bins of the rich, and begin restoring our middle class.</p>

          <p>It’s time to re-normalize taxes on the morbidly rich (and leave them where they are on working class people) so we can again have a growing economy, a prosperous middle class, and a revival of the America Dream.</p>

          The American Dream requires a healthy populace who aren’t crushed by medical costs</h2>
        <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">The American Dream requires a healthy populace who aren’t crushed by medical costs
The United States is the only country in the developed world that doesn’t define healthcare as an absolute right for all of its citizens.</p>

          <p>That’s it. We’re the only one left. We’re the only country in the developed world where somebody getting sick can leave a family bankrupt, destitute, and homeless.</p>

          <p>A half-million American families are wiped out every year so completely that they must lose everything and declare bankruptcy just because somebody got sick. The number of health-expense-related bankruptcies in all the other developed countries in the world combined is zero.</p>

          <p>Yet the United States spends more on “healthcare” than any other country in the world: about 17% of GDP.[cxxxii]</p>

          <p>Switzerland, Germany, France, Sweden and Japan all average around 11%, and Canada, Denmark, Belgium, Austria, Norway, Netherlands, United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia all come in between 9.3% and 10.5%.[cxxxiii]</p>

          <p>Health insurance premiums right now make up about 22% of all taxable payroll (and don’t even cover all working people), whereas Medicare For All would run an estimated 10% and would cover every man, woman, and child in America.[cxxxiv]</p>

          <p>How and why are Americans being played for such suckers?</p>

          <p>We are the only developed country in the world with an entire multi-billion-dollar for-profit industry devoted to parasitically extracting money from us to then turn over to healthcare providers on our behalf. The for-profit health insurance industry has attached itself to us like a giant, bloodsucking tick.</p>

          <p>And it’s not like we haven’t tried to remove that parasite.</p>

          <p>Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson all proposed and failed to bring a national healthcare system to the United States.[cxxxv]</p>

          <p>When I did a deep dive into the topic for my book The Hidden History of American Healthcare I found two major barriers to our removing that tick from our backs.</p>

          <p>The early opposition, more than 100 years ago, to a national healthcare system came from southern white congressmen (they were all men) and senators who didn’t want even the possibility that Black people could benefit, health-wise, from white people’s tax dollars. (This thinking apparently still motivates many white Southern politicians.)</p>

          <p>The leader of that healthcare-opposition movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was a German immigrant named Frederick Hoffman. Hoffman was a senior executive for the Prudential Insurance Company and wrote several books about the racial inferiority of Black people, a topic he traveled the country lecturing about.</p>

          <p>His most well-known book was titled Race Traits and Tendencies of the American Negro.[cxxxvi] It became a major best-seller across America when it was first published for the American Economic Association by the Macmillan Company in 1896, the same year the Supreme Court’s Plessy v Ferguson decision legally turned the entire US into an apartheid state.</p>

          <p>Hoffman taught that Black people, in the absence of slavery, were so physically and intellectually inferior to whites that if they were simply deprived of healthcare the entire race would die out in a few generations. Denying healthcare to Black people, he said, would “solve the race problem in America.”</p>

          <p>Southern politicians quoted Hoffman at length, he was invited to speak before Congress, and was hailed as a pioneer in the field of “scientific racism.” Race Traits was one of the most influential books of its era.</p>

          <p>By the 1920s, the insurance company he was a vice president of was moving from life insurance into the health insurance field, which brought an added incentive to lobby hard against any sort of a national healthcare plan.</p>

          <p>Which brings us to the second reason America has no national healthcare system: profits.</p>

<blockquote>
“Dollar” Bill McGuire, a recent CEO of America’s largest health insurer, UnitedHealth, made about $1.5 billion dollars during his time with that company.[cxxxvii] To avoid prosecution in 2007 he had to cough up $468 million, but still walked away a billionaire. Stephen J Hemsley, his successor, made off with around half a billion.</p>
</blockquote>

          <p>And that’s just one of multiple giant insurance companies feeding at the trough of your healthcare needs.[cxxxviii]</p>

          <p>Much of that money, and the pay for the multiple senior executives at that and other insurance companies who make over $1 million a year, came from saying “No!” to people who file claims for payment of their healthcare costs.</p>

          <p>This became so painful for Cigna Vice President Wendell Potter that he resigned in disgust after a teenager he knew was denied payment for a transplant and died.[cxxxix] He then wrote a brilliant book about his experience in the industry: Deadly Spin: An Insurance Company Insider Speaks Out on How Corporate PR Is Killing Health Care and Deceiving Americans.[cxl]</p>

          <p>Companies offering such “primary” health insurance simply don’t exist (or are tiny) in every other developed country in the world but one. Mostly, where they do exist, they serve wealthier people looking for “extras” beyond the national system, like luxury hospital suites or air ambulances when overseas. (Switzerland is the outlier with exclusively private insurance, but it’s subsidized, mandatory, cheap, and non-profit.)</p>

          <p>If Americans don’t know this, they intuit it.</p>

          <p>In the 2020 election there were quite a few issues on statewide ballots around the country. Only three of them outpolled Joe Biden’s win and expanding Medicaid to cover everybody was at the top of that list. (The other two were raising the minimum wage and legalizing pot.)</p>

          <p>The last successful effort to provide government funded, single-payer healthcare insurance was when Lyndon Johnson passed Medicare and Medicaid (both single-payer systems) in the 1960s. It was a heck of an effort, but the health insurance industry was then a tiny fraction of its current size.</p>

          <p>In 1978, when Republicans on the Supreme Court legalized corporations owning politicians with their Buckley v Bellotti decision (written by Justice Louis Powell of “Powell Memo” fame), they made the entire process of replacing a profitable industry with government-funded programs like single-payer vastly more difficult, regardless of how much good they may do for the citizens of the nation.[cxli]</p>

          <p>The Court then doubled-down on that decision in 2010, when the all-Republican decision on Citizens United cemented the power of billionaires and giant corporations to own politicians and even write and influence legislation and the legislative process.</p>

          <p>Medicare For All, like Canada has, would save American families thousands every year immediately and do away with the 500,000+ annual bankruptcies in this country that happen only because somebody in the family got sick.</p>

          <p>But it would kill the billions every week in profits of the half-dozen corporate giants that dominate the health insurance industry.</p>

          <p>Thus, the political corruption five Republicans on the Supreme Court embedded like a cancer in the heart of our democracy is killing millions of Americans at the same time it’s making a handful of insurance and drug company executives and stockholders richer than Midas.</p>

          Paid Sick Leave and Low-Cost Child Care to Revive the American Dream</h2>
        <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Paid Sick Leave and Low-Cost Child Care to Revive the American Dream
Most of America’s labor and childcare policies were established or find their foundation in FDR’s New Deal and the work of his Labor Secretary, Francis Perkins. At the time, women had few rights and little economic or political power.</p>

          <p>Their opportunities in the workplace were strictly circumscribed (I still remember, in the 1970s, The Lansing State Journal requiring me to place a “Help Wanted: Secretary” classified ad in the “Women Wanted” section), pay was correspondingly low, and benefits were non-existent.</p>

          <p>A historian for the US Department of Labor tells a story that was repeated often back in the early 1930s before the passage of federal New Deal labor protections:</p>

<blockquote>
“While President Franklin Roosevelt was in Bedford, Mass., campaigning for reelection, a young girl tried to pass him an envelope. But a policeman threw her back into the crowd. Roosevelt told an aide, ‘Get the note from the girl.’

“Her note read, ‘I wish you could do something to help us girls....We have been working in a sewing factory,... and up to a few months ago we were getting our minimum pay of $11 a week... Today the 200 of us girls have been cut down to $4 and $5 and $6 a week.’

“To a reporter's question, the President replied, ‘Something has to be done about the elimination of child labor and long hours and starvation wages [for women].’”[cxlii]
</blockquote>

          <p>The battle over working conditions and pay was particularly bitter in the South. As one Indiana congressman said during a 1937 debate on legislation to establish a minimum wage:</p>

<blockquote>
“There are in the State of Georgia, canning factories working ... women 10 hours a day for $4.50 a week. Can the canning factories of Indiana, Connecticut, and New York continue to exist and meet such competitive labor costs?”[cxliii]
</blockquote>

          <p>The result — after considerable public pressure by FDR and Perkins — was the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), which established the minimum wage, created boundaries on the ability of employers to exploit workers, and outlawed child labor but also — because of the hostile-to-women-in-the-workplace business climate of the day — ended up cutting the working opportunities for women.</p>

          <p>The result was that most families subsisted on a single paycheck, and the “homemaker mom” was the norm across America. Outside of the upper middle class and the morbidly rich, childcare that would allow leisure or work time for mom was an exotic luxury.</p>

          <p>Travel was also far more expensive and inconvenient than it is today, so families tended to live closer to grandparents, who, when mom did work, could often fill that childcare gap. I saw this in my own family: my stay-at-home mom cared for several of my brothers’ kids over the decades when my sisters-in-law went to work in the 1980s.</p>

          <p>That era — the Reagan/Bush Revolution 1980s — was the transitional time. As Reagan took a meataxe to unions and cut taxes on the morbidly rich while raising them repeatedly on the middle class, working class wages and take-home pay first froze and then began to collapse at the same time housing and deregulated medical costs were exploding. Mom, in many cases, had no choice but to go to work if the family wanted to continue to live the American Dream. [cxliv]</p>

          <p>In pushing women into the workplace to make up for dad’s loss of income and the shipping of good jobs overseas, Reagan and his neoliberal heirs had some help. The birth control pill was legalized in 1961 and was in widespread use by 1965. Abortion was legalized with the Supreme Court’s Roe v Wade decision in 1973.</p>

          <p>As women gained control of their own fertility and the women’s movement expanded workplace opportunities, the economic definition of the normal American family shifted from a single breadwinner to two (or more).</p>

          <p>When you look at household income statistics you see that they’ve been steadily but incrementally growing ever since the 1970s[cxlv]; when you look at individual income, though, the story is quite different, as pay only increased slightly, then declined, particularly over the past two decades, in the years since Reagan put the US into his trickle-down model.[cxlvi]</p>

          <p>Many of these dynamics — particularly the empowerment of women in the job market post-1960s — are not unique to the US. Developed countries across the world have stepped up to backstop women in their entry into the workplace by providing, paying for, or subsidizing childcare from an early age. These policies are then amplified by family leave provisions that cover months and sometimes years after childbirth.</p>

          <p>As Claire Cain Miller noted in The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
“Typical 2-year-olds in Denmark attend childcare during the day, where they are guaranteed a spot, and their parents pay no more than 25 percent of the cost. That guaranteed spot will remain until the children are in after-school care at age 10. If their parents choose to stay home or hire a nanny, the government helps pay for that, too.”[cxlvii]
</blockquote>

          <p>Miller notes that rich countries “contribute an average of $14,000 a year for a toddler’s care” while here in the US it’s around $500.</p>

          <p>And it really is that stark. Norway, at the top of the OECD list, spends an average $29,276 per child per year and Hungary, at the bottom, spends $7,222. The OECD average is $14,436. As noted, the US spends $500.</p>

          <p>President Biden proposed legislation in 2022 that would cap American families’ childcare expenses at 7 percent of their income, but Republicans in Congress killed that part of what ultimately became the Inflation Reduction Act. [cxlviii] [cxlix]</p>

          <p>Another crisis for working families — particularly two-income working families without union protections — is illness. In addition to the costs of illness and the constant rip-offs by insurance companies demanding co-pays and pre-approval for tests and procedures, millions of American workers don’t have paid time off work when they fall sick.</p>

          <p>While 76 percent of workers have access to some form of paid sick leave, those numbers are heavily skewed by high-income employees. Among the bottom 25% of workers (wage-wise) only about half have paid sick leave.[cl] For people in the bottom 10% of income it’s fewer than 30 percent.[cli]</p>

          <p>In February of 2023, President Biden called on Congress to fix that situation by passing legislation to mandate paid family and medical leave.[clii]</p>

<blockquote>
“No American should ever have to choose between a paycheck and taking care of a family member or taking care of themselves,” the President said, adding, “Workers must have access to paid leave when they face a medical or caregiving need that affects their ability to work. Yet, the United States is one of the few countries in the world that does not guarantee paid leave.”[cliii]</p>
</blockquote>

          <p>Republicans immediately announced their opposition to the proposal and at the moment it’s frozen in Congress.[cliv]</p>

          <p>Given the paucity of childcare options and the number of two-wage-earner families, family and sick leave is no luxury. Paid sick leave is even a public health issue: for example, do you want a waiter or cook sick with the flu or Covid sneezing on or handling your food? When people don’t have paid sick leave and they’re barely able to pay the rent with their wages, there’s a powerful incentive to work sick, infecting both their co-workers and their company’s customers.</p>

          <p>This is such a commonsense perspective that the United States is the only developed country in the world that neither offers paid sick leave nor paid family leave. And it’s not just the rich countries of the world: fully 98 countries mandate one or both, and even at the bottom of OECD wealth you find Slovenia with unlimited sick time and Lithuania offering 15 months of leave for childbirth or other family emergencies.[clv]</p>

          <p>Repeatedly since the 1970s Democrats have proposed both paid sick and family leave, only to see the proposals shot down repeatedly by Republicans. The result has been increased stress on our families.</p>

          <p>America gives a lot of lip service to the American Dream, but we haven’t led the world in meeting human needs since the Reagan Revolution.

          <p>It’s time to wake the hell up and start putting families above the interests of billionaires and corporate bosses who just want to squeeze every last drop of work out of their employees, consequences to them and their children be damned.</p>

          Invest in American manufacturing</h2>
        <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">The fastest and most enduring way to build broad, widespread prosperity (“the American Dream”) for any country is through manufacturing; it’s why the main job George Washington gave Alexander Hamilton was to figure out how to reboot and build American manufacturing (as I detail in The Hidden History of Neoliberalism: How Reaganism Gutted America).</p>

          <p>Many products manufactured in China — including products sold into the domestic Chinese market and equipment used by the Chinese military — require parts from America. China is trying to end this reliance on us.</p>

          <p>They’re throwing massive resources into becoming technologically independent of the United States, and it’s a safe bet that their desire to seize Taiwan the way Putin has attacked Ukraine is part of their equation.</p>

          <p>In this, China is simply doing what George Washington and Alexander Hamilton laid out in 1791, and if we don’t quickly return America to that vision — abandoned as part of the neoliberal Reaganomics’ “free trade” scam — the 21st-century will, indeed, be the “Chinese Century.”[clvi]</p>

          <p>Technological independence and international trade policy are, it turns out, two sides of the same coin.</p>

          <p>​In 2016, the single topic that most likely propelled Donald Trump to the White House in Midwestern swing states was “free trade,” as he repeatedly pointed out the stupidity of promoting offshore manufacturing simply to reduce labor expenses.</p>

          <p>He promised to bring manufacturing back to America, and voters in the former manufacturing powerhouses of the Midwest bought his sales pitch. (Sadly, he was so incompetent that his efforts actually made things worse.)</p>

          <p>Trump wasn’t the first president to understand the importance of this, however.</p>

          <p>​When General Henry Knox rode up to Mount Vernon in the late summer of 1789 to tell George Washington that Congress had just elected him as the first President of the United States, Washington had two requests for his old friend.</p>

          <p>First, he asked Knox to let folks know he’d be delayed by a few days because he wanted to say goodbye to his mother, who was elderly and ailing (turned out, it was the last time he saw her alive).</p>

          <p>Second, Washington asked General Knox to ride all the way up to Delaware to visit Daniel Hinsdale, a man who’d been manufacturing black-market American-made fine men’s clothing in defiance of British law for several decades. Knox brought to New York (where the swearing-in took place on what is now Wall Street) a fine American-made suit, which Washington proudly wore.[clvii]</p>

          <p>​Thirteen years earlier, British economist Adam Smith had made worldwide headlines with his bestselling 1776 book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, proposing that the main thing that made a country rich was independence in manufacturing.[clviii]</p>

          <p>The process of converting raw materials with little value into finished products was, to Smith’s mind, the best and only practical way a nation could grow wealthy without overseas conquest and plunder.</p>

          <p>A tree limb in the forest, for example, had no monetary value, but when labor and the tool of a knife were applied to it and it was turned into an axe-handle, it now had a value that could be passed down through the generations — what Smith called wealth.</p>

          <p>That axe-handle became part of the wealth of the entire nation, and even if it was sold overseas that wealth would still be centered here because its value was simply converted into currency which stayed in America.</p>

          <p>This understanding led President Washington to commission his Treasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton, to propose in 1791 his 11-step Report on the Subject of Manufactures, also known as “The American Plan.”[clix]</p>

          <p>Hamilton proposed protective tariffs on then-imported goods that could be made in the USA, government subsidies for companies that wanted to move manufacturing from overseas to the US, federal subsidies for the development of new technologies, a massive investment in infrastructure (particularly roads and water-power systems) to support industry, and a requirement that the US government purchase only American-made products whenever possible.</p>

          <p>By 1793 Congress and the Washington administration had put nearly all of his plan into effect, and major parts of it stood all the way up until Reagan’s neoliberal revolution.</p>

          <p>​Hamilton’s plan was such an important part of the story of America becoming the wealthiest nation on Earth that virtually 100% of the cost of operating our federal government from our founding until the Civil War came from tariffs.</p>

          <p>The salary of every president from George Washington to Abraham Lincoln was paid by tariffs, as was the salary of every federal official and the cost of everything else the federal government did.</p>

          <p>Fully two-thirds of government revenue came from tariffs from the end of the Civil War until World War I, and a third of government revenue came from tariffs between then and the Reagan Revolution of the 1980s. (Today it is under 2%.)[clx]</p>

          <p>American manufacturing was at the core of the American Dream, with good union manufacturing jobs offering stability and prosperity to a growing American middle class. It also made America the technological leader of the entire planet.</p>

          <p>Nixon had “opened” China on behalf of Pepsi, and Reagan and Bush negotiated the NAFTA agreement that was at the heart of the 1992 presidential campaign. “Free trade” was such a hot issue that year that it brought billionaire Ross Perot in as a single-issue candidate with his famous “giant sucking sound from south of the border” commentary: he carried almost 20 percent of the vote on that single issue.</p>

          <p>This isn’t the first time trade was at the center of American political debate. Back during the Republican Great Depression, Congress passed and President Roosevelt signed the “Buy American Act,” which mandated all government purchases must come from American manufacturers.[clxi]</p>

          <p>FDR and the Democrats saw government purchases of American-made products as such a big magnet, able to hold American manufacturers to our shores, that they could even slightly reduce tariffs with the rest of the world, something FDR had campaigned on in 1932. (Average tariffs on imported products at that time ran between 20% and 40%.)[clxii]</p>

          <p>In part because of the Buy America Act, the US dropped tariffs dramatically after World War II, but American manufacturing continued to dominate products sold in this country and around the world largely because of nontariff trade barriers, government purchasing, and partially because of the destruction of Japan and Germany in World War II.</p>
          <p>Sam Walton’s autobiography, titled Made in America, epitomized the situation prior to Reaganism when Wal-Marts had big “100% Made In America” banners.[clxiii]</p>
          <p>​During the 1980s, though, President Reagan radically expanded the use of a loophole in the Buy American Act that allowed the president to sign “waivers” to allow government agencies to purchase things from offshore manufacturers.</p>
          <p>The waiver provision was in the law so our government wouldn’t be crippled if it immediately needed something that wasn’t domestically available; the assumption was that they would be used judiciously and rarely. And that was the case until the 1980s, when Reagan started handing out waivers like jellybeans.</p>

          <p>As American government purchases of US-made products declined, so did US manufacturing jobs; it was the beginning of the destruction of the America middle class’s prosperity, previously fueled by domestic manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Around that same time, another rationale for corporations seeking cheap labor and easy pollution regulations overseas began to take hold in the minds of the neoliberal intelligentsia: “free trade,” they said, was so magical it could even bring about world peace!</p>

          <p>The argument was simple: history showed, they said, that countries that traded heavily with each other rarely went to war with each other. The example most often cited was that no two countries with MacDonald’s burger outlets had ever, at that time, gone to war (although they have since: see Russia and Ukraine).</p>

          <p>This was also one of the main rationales for the development of the European Union, and it makes a lot of sense with countries that are contiguous and share similar levels of development. (Somehow they manage to overlook how dependent much of Europe was on German manufacturing during Hitler’s time.)[clxiv]</p>

          <p>But the argument for trade as a tool to prevent war totally falls apart when that rationale is used as an excuse to ship manufacturing for products in heavy domestic demand to offshore facilities simply because labor is cheaper and environmental regulations are weaker.</p>

          <p>​In 1981, IBM introduced the first major-market personal computer, the famous “Model 5150” otherwise known as the IBM PC. By 1983, they were selling a quarter million a year, and the federal government was ramping up purchases.</p>

          <p>As IBM turned to offshore suppliers for more and more of their components, the trickle of Reagan’s waivers turned into a flood.

          <p>Bill Clinton continued the practice, and by 2000 IBM had moved all their production offshore (as had their major competitor, Apple) and Wal-Mart, founded on Sam Walton’s slogan of “100% Made in the USA,” had become America’s largest importer of Chinese-manufactured goods.</p>

          <p>Thomas Friedman jumped into the act at the end of the 20th century, promoting the transfer of American manufacturing overseas with his now-discredited 1999 book The Lexus and the Olive Tree.[clxv]</p>

          <p>Its impact, along with major campaigns encouraging “free trade” funded by American industrial and retail giants, echoed across American manufacturing and foreign policy for the next 20 years, as America continued to hemorrhage jobs and the middle class “American Dream” wealth that accompany them.</p>

          <p>As a vast proportion of American manufacturing shifted to China, that nation underwent the most rapid transformation from poverty to First World affluence in the history of the world.</p>

          <p>The “wealth” of America was transferred to China every time a cash-register rang at Walmart, an Apple Store, or in pretty much any other American retail outlet.</p>

          <p>​The issue of so-called “free trade” is one that has galvanized Americans repeatedly throughout the history of America, from Hamilton’s “American Plan” to FDR’s Buy American Act to battles over NAFTA in the 1992 election and Trump’s election in 2016 with China at the center of his sales pitch.</p>
          <p>And while tariffs around the world have generally collapsed, which is arguably a good thing because it increases general world prosperity, there are dozens of other tools America and other countries can use to encourage domestic manufacturing and technological innovation.</p>

          <p>The progressive wing of the Democratic Party has opposed neoliberal “free trade” policies since the 1930s, and continues to do so to this day; Senators Bernie Sanders and Sherrod Brown, for example, have been relentless champions of campaigns to derail these policies and bring manufacturing back home.[clxvi]</p>

          <p>As that part of the Democratic Party gains power, “free trade” will again be at the center of American political debate.</p>

          <p>China, meanwhile, wants to keep American manufacturing within their borders, both for the revenue, to keep America helpless in the face of a threatened embargo (as may happen if we defend Taiwan), and — according to concerned intelligence officials — so they can insert into US-bound tech products the ability to spy on us.[clxvii]</p>

          <p>A powerful, and relatively uncontroversial step the Biden administration could take now to reduce our dependence on China and begin restoring American manufacturing and technology would be to simply reduce the number of waivers to the Buy American Act, and for Congress to strengthen that legislation.</p>

          <p>Government spending represents about 1/6th of the American economy, and if (as both Alexander Hamilton and Franklin Roosevelt demanded) that spending is again limited to products made in the USA, every manufacturing company in the country will rush to rebuild their US factories and R&D facilities.[clxviii]</p>

          <p>America is today engaged in a war of sorts with China to control the wealth that manufacturing produces. Our different systems of governance and economics are also competing for the hearts and minds of the developing world.</p>

          <p>The stakes are enormous, and particularly include whether American working people will still be able to achieve the middle class.</p>

          <p>Combined with strengthening US alliances with Western Europe, returning manufacturing to our nation is the most important step we can take to balance China’s growing influence and power, both economic, military and political, and restore the American Dream.</p>

        Entrepreneurship and the American Dream</h2>
        <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">I started my first business at the age of 17 with $25. I paid that amount to rent a shelf in a head shop (which sold mostly pipes, bongs, and cigarette papers) across the street from Michigan State University in East Lansing.</p>

          <p>The shelf had a sign: “The Electronics Joint—leave your stereo or TV here for repair, and we’ll return it fixed within a week. Free estimate of charges before work is done.” The guy who ran the head shop managed the shelf for 10 percent of our revenues plus the $25-per-month shelf rental; within two years the venture had grown to include five employees, and we moved into our own storefront down the street.</p>

          <p>As the business grew, however, I didn’t manage it wisely and ended up about $3,000 in debt, which was a lot of money in 1968 for a part-time student and part-time DJ. Ultimately, I had to shut the company down, declare bankruptcy, and go back to work full-time as a radio DJ.</p>

          <p>That didn’t turn out so well either. I got fired when I played two Black female artists back-to-back, a violation of station policy at the time, and then refused to promise to never do it again.</p>

          <p>With my unemployment check, I bought some herbs at a local General Nutrition Center store and started an herbal tea company — Woodley Herber — that grew over the next six years to 19 employees. One of our products that contained ginseng (which was then hot as an aphrodisiac) was picked up by Larry Flynt to market through his brand-new magazine, Hustler, making him a million bucks and turning a nice profit for my partner and me. Louise and I sold our half of that company to our employees in 1978 to move to New Hampshire and start a community for abused kids.</p>

          <p>We wiped out our savings buying land for the children’s village and living for almost five years on a salary of $25 per week. I still had an American Express Platinum Card, a leftover from the prosperous Woodley Herber days, so in 1983, with a $10,000 (or was it $15,000?) line of credit against that card and some income from writing for a few magazines (I was contributing editor to seven of them that year), Louise and I moved to Atlanta and opened International Wholesale Travel and its retail operation Sprayberry Travel.</p>

          <p>That turned out to be quite a success. Within three years we’d marketed the company onto the front page of the Wall Street Journal and had about $6 million in annual revenues, so we sold the company in 1986 to retire to Germany for a year to do volunteer work for the international relief agency Salem International.</p>

          <p>We moved back to Atlanta in 1987 and used about $50,000 we had left from selling the travel company to start an advertising agency, The Newsletter Factory, which quickly grew to generating several million dollars a year in revenue and had about 20 employees. We sold that business to our employees on a seven-year buyout in 1996 and retired to the backwoods of Vermont to write books and enjoy life.</p>

          <p>That didn’t last, either: Thanksgiving week of 2002 we drove back to Michigan to spend the holidays with family and all the way there all we could hear on the radio was rightwing talk. So, I wrote an article for Common Dreams titled Talking Back to Talk Radio positing that within a politically 50/50 nation there should be Democratic/left voices on the radio, too.</p>

          <p>A married couple who were venture capitalists, Shelly and Anita Drobney, reached out and asked me to fly to Chicago to meet with them, and, to make a long story short, that article became the first business plan for Air America Radio, as Shelly documented (and reprinted my article) in his book The Road to Air America.[clxix]</p>

          <p>As of this writing, I’m in the 21st year of The Thom Hartmann Program that’s been the #1 progressive radio talk show in America for well over a decade. It’s become a business itself (although it’s the one business we didn’t set out to do that way: it was supposed to just be “proof of concept” for Air America), and more recently we’ve started a series of Substack publications on politics, ADHD, and NeuroLinguistic Programming that are also adding to our retirement funds.</p>

          <p>All of this is by way of saying that I am a somewhat typical “serial entrepreneur,” and fortunately we have a lot of them in America. They are generally middle-class people (my dad worked in a tool-and-die shop for 40 years, and my mom was a full-time homemaker with four sons), they generally do not have an inheritance or family money to draw on, and yet they spend their lives pursuing the American Dream.</p>

          <p>It’s what I’ve been living since I was a teenager when I started The Electronics Joint.</p>

          <p>Increasingly, though, that part of the American Dream is under assault from the monopoly power of big business.</p>

          <p>In a way, this is “back to the future.” In the 1880s, John D Rockefeller, for example, used to buy up all the available railroad contracts for shipping oil to prevent smaller competitors from getting their product to market. Once they were in trouble financially, he’d give them “an offer they couldn’t refuse” and buy them out, making his large company even larger.</p>

          <p>Andrew Carnegie did this with steel and JP Morgan did it with banking; there were trusts and monopolies in fields as disparate as manufacturing matches, refining and selling sugar, and building railroad cars.</p>

          <p>By the late 19th century the situation had become so intolerable that Congress put into place the first anti-trust laws.</p>

          <p>Before the Reagan Revolution, those anti-trust and anti-monopoly laws — dating all the way back to the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890 — were largely enforced and kept big corporations in check.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was created in 1915 by Democratic President Woodrow Wilson, specifically to break up concentrated business trusts and monopolies, using the Justice Department as its prosecutorial arm. It came into being against a backdrop of public outrage over giant corporations screwing consumers and owning captive politicians.</p>

          <p>As President Teddy Roosevelt, the great trust buster, said a decade earlier, “There can be no effective control of corporations while their political activity remains.” Indeed, it took a decade to create the agency that Roosevelt had proposed, as I detail in The Hidden History of Monopolies: How Big Business Destroyed the American Dream.</p>

          <p>Probably the FTC’s most well-known effort was breaking up the telephone behemoth AT&T, an action started during the Nixon administration that, when completed in 1982, produced an explosion of competitive activity that dropped phone call costs, increased availability, and spurred the creation of hundreds of new companies in the telecom arena.</p>

          <p>Even the Supreme Court, back in the day, agreed that giant corporations dominating markets was bad for the economy and our political system.</p>

          <p>In the 1962 antitrust case of Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, for example, the Supreme Court agreed with the FTC and blocked the merger of Brown and G. R. Kinney, two shoe manufacturers, because the combination of the two would have captured about 5% of the US shoe market.[clxx] For comparison, Nike today has 19% of the US shoe market.[clxxi]</p>

          <p>All of that anti-trust activity came to an end in 1982 when President Reagan appointed William C. Miller III, his former executive director of the Presidential Task Force on Regulatory Relief, to take over the FTC. Miller was the first pro-corporate leader in the nation’s history to corrupt the agency that was supposed to regulate corporate misbehavior.[clxxii]</p>

          <p>That year (as it had been since the 1930s) most of this nation’s business activity was centered in the cash registers of our small- and medium-sized companies. The total value of America’s largest corporations — those listed on stock exchanges — was equal to just 39.4% of the entire nation’s economic activity or GDP in 1981.[clxxiii]</p>

          <p>Miller, however, declined to continue enforcing our anti-trust laws and in 1983 Reagan instructed the DOJ to, essentially, stop prosecuting companies that were violating those laws through mergers and acquisitions, and to only go after the most egregious and flagrant acts of corporate collusion and price-fixing.[clxxiv]</p>

          <p>As a result, large companies became behemoths, and pretty much every industry in America is today dominated by a small handful of companies that carefully monitor each other to function, essentially, as cartels. When United raises ticket prices by $50, for example, American does the same three hours later.</p>

          <p>Which is why today the total value of America’s exchange-listed corporations is 194.9% of GDP, elbowing out most small- and medium-sized companies.</p>

          <p>As Jonathan Tepper pointed out in The Myth of Capitalism, fully 90% of the beer that Americans drink is controlled by two companies.[clxxv] Air travel is mostly controlled by four companies, and over half of the nation’s banking is done by five banks.</p>

          <p>In multiple states there are only one or two health insurance companies, high-speed internet is in a near-monopoly state virtually everywhere in America (75% of us can “choose” only one company), and three companies control around three-quarters of the entire pesticide and seed markets.</p>

          <p>The vast majority of radio and TV stations in the country are owned by a small handful of companies, and the internet is dominated by Google, Facebook, and Amazon.</p>

          <p>This has handed enormous power to the CEOs and senior managers of America’s largest companies, all of them multi-multi-millionaires and many billionaires. And none of them like competition from small companies like the ones I started throughout my life and American entrepreneurs today are doing their best to launch in the face of overwhelming odds when confronting one of these American behemoths.</p>

          <p>If we want to bring back entrepreneurship to America, we must first restore our anti-trust laws to their former power.</p>

          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">What if, lacking an organized resistance to fascism 
            like we have had in previous eras (the civil rights movement, SDS, BLM, the 
            Wobbly’s) the Democratic Party itself could play the role of producing radical, 
            positive transformation across America? Sound crazy? It’s actually happened 
            twice.</p>
          <p>The first time was in the 1930s, when Franklin Roosevelt’ New Deal literally 
            flipped our politics and the American economy upside down, turning us from a 
            raw, harsh capitalist system to a democratic socialist system with Social 
            Security, legalized unions, unemployment insurance, a minimum wage, workplace 
            safety rules, massive infrastructure construction, and millions of Americans 
            being employed directly by the government to end poverty.</p>
          <p>It happened again in the 1960s, with Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society, producing 
            Medicare, Medicaid, the civil rights act, the voting rights act, food stamps, 
            low income housing, National Public Radio, a transformation of our educational 
            system for the better, USAID, Job Corps, VISTA, Head Start, a major Social 
            Security expansion, The National Endowment for the Arts, and what was essentially 
            free college.</p>
          <p>Sunday, I was on Ali Velshi’s show on MSNBC in a conversation about protest 
            movements. I pointed out that back in the 60s, when I was in SDS, there were a 
            number of groups that were quite active, particularly on college campuses, but 
            today most of them have been gutted or banned.</p>
          <p>Black Lives Matter has disintegrated, the movement against Israel’s slaughter 
            in Gaza has led to universities rolling over and capitulating, and the #MeToo 
            and abortion rights movements are essentially leaderless. Which leaves the 
            Democratic Party, as I mentioned on Ali’s show. Billionaires and racists turned 
            the Republican Party into a neofascist protest party over the past decade; 
            progressives and those of us who want to preserve democracy in America need 
            to similarly seize control of and radicalize the Democratic Party in the tradition 
            of FDR and LBJ.</p>
          <p>There is a vital lesson progressives must learn, which is how the far right took 
            control of the Republican Party over a decade ago and forced the entire Conservative 
            establishment to lurch so far to the Right that they’ve even dumped people like Liz 
            Cheney and George W. Bush.</p>
          <p>If progressives hope to have any shot at influencing today’s Democratic Party and 
            kicking out the corporate sellout Democrats and replacing them with real-deal 
            progressives, then we need to get to work right now to do exactly what the Tea 
            Party did a decade and a half ago to take power. And it starts in our own backyards.</p>
          <p>Let me introduce you to the now-defunct Concord Project, a right-wing organization 
            that, a decade ago, was in charge of helping the Tea Party’s successful effort to 
            take over and radicalize the GOP.</p>
          <p>The Concord Project expanded their get-out-the-vote strategy beyond just traditional 
            phone banking, canvassing, and putting up “vote Republican” signs. Instead, they 
            decided to infiltrate local politics by encouraging Tea Partiers and conservatives 
            more generally to become “Precinct Committee Members.” Here’s their pitch in their 
            own words from one of their Obama-era YouTube training videos:</p>
          <p>“What’s the most powerful political office in the world? It is not the President of 
            the United States. It’s Precinct Committeeman.” So why is a Precinct Committeeman (or 
            person) so important?</p>
          <p>“First, because precinct committeemen and only precinct committeemen get to elect the 
            leaders of the political parties; if you want to elect the leadership of one of the 
            two major political parties in this country, then you have to become a precinct 
            committeeman.”</p>
          <p>As in the oldest and most basic governing reality in a republic: true and effective 
            political power flows up from the bottom. It starts with Precinct Committeemen and women 
            — people who are either appointed or win local elections with very few votes at stake, 
            in some cases only 10 or 20 votes — to gain positions that pretty much anyone can hold 
            but which wield enormous power.</p>
          <p>It’s Precinct Committee Persons who elect district, county, and state party officials 
            and delegates, who choose primary nominees that then go on to hold elected office, 
            and who help draft a party’s platform. They’re also generally the first people who 
            elected officials meet with when they come back into the district. And those officials 
            listen carefully to what Precinct Committee persons have to say.</p>
          <p>So, the Concord folks told their people, if far right Tea Partiers moved in and took 
            over Precinct Committee seats then they’d also be able to nominate a slew of Tea 
            Partiers to hold higher offices within the Republican Party and for primaries.
            And those Tea Party Republican Party primary candidates would then be winnowed down 
            in the primary to one Tea Party Republican to run against the Democrat in the general 
            election. This way, Tea Partiers would end up dominating the GOP.</p>
          <p>That was their pitch: take over the party from the inside, from the bottom up. And it 
            worked. Control the primaries — as the Precinct Committee Members do — and you control 
            the ultimate candidate, the election, and ultimately the nation, as we’ve seen repeatedly 
            since the Tea Party era. This is from a video they posted in January of 2010, with the same 
            Concord Project Representative encouraging people in the Tea Party to do exactly what I 
            just described:</p>
          <p>“This video is for all the people out there in the Tea Party movement, the 9/12ers, 
            just good decent people who are really fearful of what’s going on in the country and 
            want to do something to fix things and they’re not sure what to do. Well, I’ve got a 
            solution for you. The best way to ensure that conservatives win that all-important 
            primary election is to become a real ball player in the ball game of politics. And 
            that ball game is called party politics.</p>
          <p>“And this is a secret, they don’t want the party establishments, any incumbents don’t 
            want you to know about this and that’s why I’m telling you about it. Only precinct 
            committeemen get to vote for, to elect party leaders. Only precinct committeemen can 
            vote to endorse candidates.” Again, that was in 2010, 11 months before that year’s 
            elections.</p>
          <p>In 2008, half of the Republican Party’s Precinct Committeemen positions around the 
            country were vacant. But by 2011, motivated by the efforts of people like the Concord 
            Project, the Tea Party (which has now mostly morphed into MAGA) had swept in to fill 
            the gaps: They’d filled up the Republican Party.</p>
          <p>And we saw the results of the Precinct Committee takeover first in 2012 and more and 
            more vividly in every election since: the GOP is now being driven largely from the 
            bottom up by activists who’ve taken over the party and are also running for school 
            boards and other local offices.</p>
          <p>In 2012, after this campaign to get movement conservatives into the GOP, Tea Party 
            candidates got onto nearly every ballot around the country and picked up 87 new 
            seats in the US House of Representatives and 9 new seats in the Senate.</p>
          <p>And even though the Tea Party didn’t then control a majority within the GOP in 
            Congress like MAGA does now, they did control the Republican Party’s platform 
            because they had control of the Precinct Committees.</p>
          <p>Progressives and believers in democracy who want to fight Trump’s fascism need to do 
            the same thing, only within the Democratic Party. The rules about how to become a 
            Precinct Committee Person vary from state to state, so step one is to show up at your 
            local Democratic Party, sign up, and find out who the players are and what the rules are.</p>
          <p>Even the names of these positions vary, as former Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David 
            Pepper notes on his excellent Substack newsletter Pepperspectives: “In Cincinnati, we 
            call them ‘precinct executives.’ Elsewhere, they are called ‘committeemen’ or 
            ‘committeewomen.’ In other places, ‘ward chairs.’ Whatever they’re called, they are 
            the basic unit of each city or county party structure in the country.”</p>
          <p>If we’ve learned one thing over the last few years, it’s that the Democratic Party 
            shifted to the corporate “center” with Clinton and Obama and its establishment has 
            been highly resistant to adopting real progressive change or elevating genuine 
            progressives (like AOC) to senior/leadership positions.</p>
          <p>And as we see right now in the Party’s leadership’s apparent inability to call out 
            Trump and his parade of horribles, this unwillingness to stand up and fight is 
            leading to the dismantling of programs that progressives fought so hard for over 
            the entire last century.</p>
          <p>We have been too often losing these fights, and to win them takes more than union 
            protests in Wisconsin, a march on Trump’s birthday, or even voting, although those 
            are all important.</p>
          <p>But to really take power, like the Tea Party did in one short year, it will take an 
            infiltration of the Democratic Party itself through claiming Precinct Committee 
            positions, as well as simply showing up regularly at the meetings.</p>
          <p>If this year, starting now, we execute the same strategy the Tea Party did in 2009 
            when the billionaires funding it first set out to take over the GOP, then we can 
            move the Democratic Party back to its progressive roots and finally see the progressive 
            reforms — and election victories — that we’ve been fighting for. We have 16 months 
            before the 2026 midterm elections and your mission is to show up at your local 
            Democratic Party headquarters and begin the infiltration.</p>
          <p>Good luck and get started!.</p>

              <b>Question the Narrative:</b><br>
              In times of political uncertainty, narratives can be 
              manipulated. Always look for the underlying messages, especially from political 
              figures or media outlets with clear biases. Fact-check, seek diverse sources, 
              and be cautious of “us vs. them” narratives that encourage division and fear.
              Don't take what Musk and Trump say seriously. They don't so why should you?<br>

            </li>
            <li><b>Engage in Constructive Dialogue</b><br>
              If you encounter different viewpoints, engage in respectful dialogue to understand 
              the reasoning behind them. This doesn’t mean you need to change your stance, but it 
              can open up channels for greater understanding and tolerance in an increasingly 
              polarized world.</li>
            <li><b>Practice Active Bystander Intervention</b><br>
              <b>Speak Up When You See Injustice:</b>
              Whether it’s at a protest, in your workplace, or even on social media, calling out 
              harmful behavior can make a difference. If you witness bullying, discrimination, or 
              hate speech, stand up against it. It can be daunting, but these small actions signal 
              that intolerance won’t be tolerated.<br>
              <b>Create Safe Spaces:</b>
              Foster safe environments for others to share their experiences, especially 
              marginalized voices. Supporting and amplifying the voices of those most affected by 
              authoritarian policies or injustices strengthens collective resistance.</li>
            <li><b>Build Political Awareness</b><br>
              <b>Understand Policy Impacts:</b>
              Pay close attention to how proposed policies, laws, or executive orders affect civil 
              liberties, marginalized groups, or the environment. Share this information with your 
              community to spark important conversations about what is at stake.</p>
              <b>Participate in Local Politics:</b>
              National politics are important, but local politics can often have a more immediate 
              impact on your daily life. Attend town hall meetings, participate in school board 
              meetings, or even consider running for local office or helping others to do so. Local 
              engagement is a critical form of resistance and an essential way to influence change 
              from the ground up.</li>
            <li><b>Practice Direct Action and Civil Disobedience</b><br>
              <b>Peaceful Protests and Marches:</b>
              While direct action carries risks, it is a powerful 
              tool for social change. Participate in marches, demonstrations, or strikes to visibly 
              show your opposition to harmful policies. These events not only express dissent but 
              also help to unite people around common causes.<br>
              <b>Boycott and Divestment:</b>
              Refuse to support companies or institutions that support 
              oppressive regimes or harmful practices. Divesting from companies involved in 
              exploitation or environmental destruction is a form of resistance. Supporting 
              businesses that promote ethical values also sends a message of what you stand for.</li>
            <li><b>Volunteer and Donate</b><br>
              <b>Support Organizations Fighting for Justice:</b>
              Many grassroots organizations are 
              working tirelessly to combat systemic injustices, protect civil rights, and advocate 
              for a better future. Volunteer your time or donate to these groups to amplify their 
              efforts. This could range from civil rights organizations to climate justice movements, 
              refugee support networks, or healthcare advocacy groups.<br>
              <b>Direct Mutual Aid:</b>
              Establish or join local mutual aid networks. These networks 
              are community-led groups that work to meet the needs of individuals within their 
              communities, especially those who may be the most vulnerable. Whether it’s food, 
              housing, or support for those facing legal battles, mutual aid can counter the 
              societal fractures that authoritarianism often thrives on.</li>
            <li><b>Foster Empathy and Compassion</b><br>
              <b>Understand Oppression at Personal Levels:</b>
              Seek to understand and empathize with 
              the lived experiences of those facing discrimination or systemic oppression. This builds 
              solidarity and strengthens your resolve to stand against injustice.<br>
              <b>Intergenerational Solidarity:</b>
              Reach out to older generations who lived through 
              difficult political times. They may have valuable lessons about resilience and survival 
              during oppressive periods. Likewise, mentoring younger generations about the importance 
              of protecting democratic norms helps build a more resilient future.</li>
            <li><b>Engage in Art and Creative Resistance</b><br>
              <b>Use Art to Speak Truth:</b>
              Art, music, and literature have always played a key role 
              in resisting oppressive regimes and in holding up a mirror to society. Whether you’re 
              creating, consuming, or sharing art that challenges the status quo, you contribute to 
              the wider cultural conversation about freedom and justice.<br>
              <b>Create Public Space for Resistance:</b>
              Public art installations, murals, or 
              performances can challenge public narratives and inspire others to think critically 
              about the direction society is heading.</li>
            <li><b>Support Independent Media</b><br>
              <b>Fight Against Media Censorship:</b>
              Many authoritarian regimes target independent 
              journalism. Support media outlets that provide unbiased reporting and investigative 
              journalism. Subscribe to independent outlets, share news from non-corporate sources, 
              and participate in campaigns that defend press freedom.<br>
              <b>Create Your Own Media:</b>
              Social media, blogs, and podcasts provide platforms to challenge dominant 
              narratives. Create or amplify media that educates, raises awareness, and 
              empowers others to take action.</li>
            <li><b>Practice Nonviolent Communication</b><br>
              <b>Resist Polarization in Conversations:</b>
              In politically charged environments, it’s easy for conversations to spiral 
              into anger or division. Practice active listening and nonviolent communication 
              when engaging with those who disagree with you. Find common ground where 
              possible, and prioritize empathy over antagonism.<br>
              <b>Build Coalitions:</b>
              Recognize that resistance isn’t always about unanimous agreement but about 
              shared goals. Work with people who may not align on every issue but agree 
              on key principles, such as protecting civil liberties or opposing 
              authoritarianism.</p></li>
            <li><b>Educate the Next Generation</b><br>
              <b>Teach Civic Engagement:</b>
              If you’re a parent, teacher, or mentor, instill the 
              value of active citizenship in younger generations. Teach them about their rights, 
              the importance of voting, and how they can become engaged and informed participants 
              in society.<br>
              <b>Promote Critical Media Literacy:</b>
              Help young people recognize misinformation 
              and learn how to navigate media landscapes responsibly. In a world where disinformation 
              is increasingly common, teaching these skills is one of the most vital forms of 
              resistance.</li>
            <li><b>Practice Long-Term Resistance</b><br>
              <b>Persevere in the Face of Setbacks:</b>
              Resistance isn’t always immediate or 
              victorious. You might not see the results of your actions right away, but don’t be 
              discouraged. Change often comes incrementally, and your continued efforts contribute 
              to a larger, ongoing struggle.<br>
              <b>Strengthen Communities of Resistance:</b>
              Work to sustain resistance over the long 
              haul. This could involve creating networks of mutual support, organizing educational 
              events, or coordinating long-term campaigns that focus on sustaining democratic 
              values in the face of authoritarian pressures.</li>
            <li><b>Resist Normalizing Oppression</b><br>
              <b>Challenge Complacency:</b>
              It’s easy for society to normalize gradual encroachments 
              on freedom. Don’t let small erosions of rights become accepted as “just the way things 
              are.” Whenever there’s a new restriction or change that feels unjust or authoritarian, 
              raise awareness about its implications and demand accountability.<br>
              <b>Support Dissenters:</b>
              Be an ally to whistleblowers, activists, and journalists who 
              take risks to expose corruption or authoritarian tendencies. Standing by those who are 
              targeted for their resistance is a powerful form of solidarity.<br>
              The ultimate goal is to create a ripple effect—small, consistent actions that together 
              build a broader movement for justice, democracy, and human rights. Even in challenging 
              times, we can choose to act with resilience, courage, and hope, knowing that our 
              resistance can help shape a better future.</li>

            <li>Fight &amp; Reverse <b>Citizens United</b><br>
              Former Republican Congressman Adam Kinsinger asks a question no current Republican 
              politician appears willing to say out loud for fear that Musk, Trump, or other rightwing 
              billionaires will use the corrupt Citizens United decision to blow them out of the water 
              politically with a multimillion-dollar primary challenge:

              <blockquote>
              “[A]s I watch the behavior of our political leaders, the comments of an ever-increasingly 
              unhinged Trump, and the growing indifference of many Americans toward our role in the world, 
              I have to ask a painful question: Are we now the bad guys?”
              </blockquote>

            <li><b>Our Founding Fathers:</b><br>
              Our nation’s Founders overthrew a king in 1776, and paid a 
              huge price for it. Altogether, seventeen of the fifty-six signers of the Declaration of 
              Independence were wiped out by the war they declared.<br>

              The signers wrote in the Declaration, “we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our 
              Fortunes and our sacred Honor,” and it was a simple statement of fact. The day they 
              signed that document, each legally became a traitor and was sentenced to death for 
              treason by the ruler who controlled their lands and their homes.<br>

              One of the wealthiest of the signers was Thomas Nelson of Virginia, but a year after the 
              signing the British had seized his home and lands. When he and George Washington 
              attacked the British in Nelson’s hometown, Nelson encouraged Washington to attack the 
              Nelson homestead, which British General Cornwallis had taken as his headquarters, with 
              cannons. The house was destroyed, and after the war Nelson, unable to repay loans he’d 
              taken out against it to help finance the Revolution, lost his property; he died in 
              poverty at the age of 50.<br>

              The wealthy Philadelphia merchant, Robert Morris, lost 150 ships at sea in the war, 
              wiping out his small fortune; he died destitute. Signer William Ellery of Rhode Island 
              similarly lost everything, as did Virginia’s Carter Braxton and Benjamin Harrison, 
              Pennsylvania’s George Clymer, New York’s Philip Livingston, Georgia’s Lyman Hall, 
              and New Jersey’s Francis Hopkinson.<br>

              The British destroyed New York’s Francis Lewis’ property and threw his wife into 
              such a hellhole of a jail that she died two years later. Three of South Carolina’s 
              four signers — Edward Rutledge, Thomas Heyward, Jr., and Arthur Middleton — were 
              captured by the British and held in a filthy, unheated prison and brutally tortured 
              for a year before George Washington freed them in a prisoner exchange.<br>
              New Jersey farmer John Hart’s wife died shortly after he signed the Declaration, and 
              his thirteen children were scattered among sympathetic families to hide them from 
              the British and conservative loyalists. He never saw them again, dying alone and 
              wracked with grief three years later.<br>
              New Jersey State Supreme Court Justice Richard Stockton took his wife and children 
              into hiding after he signed the Declaration, but conservatives loyal to the crown 
              turned them in. He was so badly beaten and starved in the British prison that he 
              died before the war was over. His home was looted, and his wife and children 
              lived the rest of their lives as paupers.<br>
              Altogether, nine of the men in that room died and four lost their children as a 
              direct result of putting their names to the Declaration of Independence. Every 
              single one had to flee his home, and, after the war, twelve returned to find only 
              rubble. They were all willing to fight and die for the idea of democracy in America. 
              Every one of them.<br>
              And now, after 236 years of existence — as Donald Trump bows to Putin and tweets 
              a picture of himself cosplaying king in a gold crown — America is on the verge 
              of becoming an entirely different type of nation.<br>
              We’ve always (or nearly always) been on the side of democracies. We fought against 
              fascists in World War II and defeated them. We helped create democratic alliances 
              in Europe and Asia; we led the fight to create the United Nations.<br>
              And now we’re joining Russia. This century’s dictatorial, imperial power.<br>
              Monday will be the third anniversary of Putin’s brutal invasion and rape of 
              Ukraine (2022,Feb - 2025,May).<br>
              When he was a US Senator, Marco Rubio said:<br>
              <blockquote>
              “Vladimir Putin is an authoritarian thug who is accountable to no one. … I don’t think 
              what Vladimir Putin exhibits is leadership: I think what he exhibits is thuggery … and 
              we should be clear-eyed about that. … At the end of the day, Hillary Clinton was part 
              of the single biggest blunder ever when it came to Vladimir Putin, and that’s the reset 
              with Russia.”
              </blockquote>
              Today, Lil’ Marco is talking about “incredible [investment] opportunities” 
              for American billionaires and US corporations who want to do business with Russia.
              Just five months ago, Republican Senator Lindsay Graham stood with Ukrainian President 
              Zelenskyy in Washington, DC and said, “You’re the best kind of ally. You fight the 
              Russians so we don’t have to.”<br>
              Today, Graham — like every other Republican senator and House member except Thom Tillis — 
              has been cowed into a terrified impotence, unwilling to do anything to stop or block 
              America’s new dictator-friendly democracy-hostile foreign policy.<br>
              Our military is being purged along hard-right ideological lines, as was the Department 
              of Justice; the FBI is next on the firing line, although reports suggest that purge 
              began weeks ago.<br>
              Virtually every major government agency is under attack by the DOGE hackers, as the 
              America government is being crippled; Putin is no doubt delighted.<br>
              Even our defense budget is scheduled to be cut with a chainsaw, just as the threat 
              from Russia and China is at the highest point in our lifetimes.<br>
              They shut down children’s cancer research, Alzheimer’s research, and food and drugs 
              for the world’s poorest people. They are laying off FAA employees at the same time 
              planes are falling out of the sky. They’re gutting the staff that processes your 
              Social Security, tax, and Medicare payments.<br>
              Trump and his MAGA crowd are tearing our government apart, apparently with 
              the goal of replacing it with something quite different than America has 
              ever experienced before.<br>
              An entirely new America. A royal America. An America of, by, and for the 
              morbidly rich.<br>
              One that resembles the vision petrobillionaire David Koch laid out in 1980 
              when he ran for Vice President on a platform calling for the destruction 
              of nearly every federal agency except the Pentagon and the end of all 
              income taxes on billionaires.<br>
              A country that will bear very little resemblance to that grand idea our 
              Founders fought and died for.<br>
              And they’re doing it as fast as they can — dismantling our country, our 
              democracy, and realigning our foreign policy — because they know once 
              Americans catch on we will rise up and try to stop them.<br>
              America’s media and our free speech rights are under ideological attack, 
              with every major television network having been sued for millions; one has already capitulated. 
              A Substack newsletter writer was sued for millions by the new FBI Director. Trump even 
              sued a small Iowa newspaper and their pollster because they offended him.<br>
              Both Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer and Congressman Robert Garcia have been 
              threatened with investigation and imprisonment by a US attorney for their comments 
              about abortion and politics, despite the Constitution protecting members of Congress 
              from such intimidation. Schumer apologized on the floor of the Senate for saying of 
              SCOTUS justices’ anti-abortion Dobbs decision, “You have released the whirlwind and 
              you will pay the price”; Garcia is defiant.<br>
              Republicans could stop this, if they will just find their spine. Every soldier in the 
              American military is willing to die for their country on a moment’s notice, every 
              single one, but elected Republicans — who are supposed to have the courage to make 
              decisions about war and peace — won’t even raise their hands or lift their voices.<br>
              History will not treat this GOP well.<br>
              And to add insult to injury, this week Trump took down the agency that protects our 
              elections from foreign interference. The same sort of influence that may well have put 
              Trump into the White House in the first place.<br>
              As The New York Times noted in an article titled “Trump Dismantles Government Fight 
              Against Foreign Influence Operations”:<br>

              <blockquote>
              “Experts are alarmed that the cuts could leave the United States defenseless against 
              covert foreign influence operations and embolden foreign adversaries seeking to disrupt 
              democratic governments.”
              </blockquote>

              Putin’s been playing Trump for a sucker since, apparently, 2017. That was when Trump’s 
              then-National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster said the president had a secret, private 
              meeting with Putin. McMaster tried to warn Trump about Putin but, he wrote in his memoir:<br>

              <blockquote>
              “Putin, a ruthless former KGB operator, played to Trump’s ego and insecurities with 
              flattery. …<br>
              “I told Trump how Putin had duped Bush and Obama. ‘Mr President, he is the best liar in 
              the world.’ I suggested that Putin was confident he could ‘play’ Trump and get what 
              he wanted, sanctions relief and the US out of Syria and Afghanistan on the cheap, by 
              manipulating Trump with ambiguous promises of a ‘better relationship’. He would offer 
              cooperation on counterterrorism, cybersecurity and arms control. “I could tell that 
              Trump was getting impatient with my ‘negative vibe’. I said what I needed to say. If 
              he was going to be contrary, I hoped he would be contrary to the Russian dictator, 
              not to me.”
              </blockquote>

              Yet here we are today, with Trump realigning America toward Putin and away from the 
              democratic republic of Ukraine and the rest of democratic Europe.<br>
              As a result, Russia’s next step is to wait until Ukraine runs out of American air 
              defense systems and then just start bombing the crap out of Ukrainian cities. 
              Millions could die and it could lead to World War III, but that seems just fine with 
              Trump.<br>
              And, apparently, that’s just fine with every Republican Senator and Congress member 
              except Tillis. America is on the verge of becoming the world’s newest thug nation 
              ruled by fabulously wealthy oligarchs and a man who would be king.<br>
              Thus, sadly, the answer to Congressman Kinsinger’s question is clear: Yes, we are now 
              the bad guys, at least for the moment. We are now on the side of the royal ideology of 
              absolute power held by that one man, the King, whose soldiers imprisoned, tortured, and 
              murdered so many of our nation’s Founders.<br>
              When Rhode Island’s Stephen Hopkins signed the Declaration of Independence, he 
              remarked to his friend William Ellery that,<br>

              <blockquote>
              “My hand trembles, but my heart does not.” But Virginia’s Benjamin Harrison, who 
              weighed nearly 300 pounds, commented to Massachusetts’ Elbridge Gerry, a short, thin 
              man, “With me it [the hanging] will all be over in a minute, but you will be dancing 
              on air an hour after I am gone.”
              </blockquote>

              Will any Republican in today’s House or Senate — the bodies those men created — find 
              even a fraction of the courage of those who founded this nation?
              The people of America — and the world — are holding their breath, waiting for the answer.

            <li>Henry Giroux is one of the foremost public intellectuals writing on issues of education 
            in the U.S. today. This book is another testament to his long-standing quest for a just, 
            egalitarian, and critical pedagogy against its distortion in the service of economic, 
            political and cultural power. His pungent style gives powerful voice to a passionate 
            commitment to youth whose futures are placed in jeopardy by an educational system that 
            marginalizes their intellectual, ethical, and emotional needs – and all too often becomes 
            complicit in their criminalization. The book should be required reading for anyone concerned 
            with the social consequences of the neoliberal assault on public education, which the present 
            administration regretfully has done little to roll back.

            <li>In this timely and compelling critique of U.S. political culture, Henry Giroux makes clear 
            how it is that Americans are living through what Hannah Arendt once called ‘dark times’, 
            times in which the violence and cruelty of human disposability remains hidden in the black 
            light of an increasingly authoritarian public realm. Passionately and incisively argued, 
            Giroux’s critique offers insight into the political and pedagogical conditions that have 
            produced a ‘zombie politics’ and its associated forms of authoritarianism. In this respect, 
            Giroux illuminates what we need to see in order to reconstitute a lost social democratic 
            imagination.

            <li>Henry Giroux offers his most passionate defense yet of democracy and civic values 
            in his new book.<br>
            This volume is a must-read in dark times like these. Giroux has for decades been an 
            outstanding tribune for democracy, an advocate for civic values and for questioning the 
            unequal status quo. In this new book, he takes up more vigorously than ever the threats to 
            the public sphere from reactionary forces gaining momentum. For Giroux, these threats to 
            humane democracy fit the ‘zombie aesthetic’ now pervading television, film, and popular 
            culture. Politics has become a monstrous caricature of public deliberation with wild 
            propositions and charges spreading fear and division. Giroux explores the hostile forces 
            sucking the blood out of our constitutional rights as well as the vitality out of ordinary 
            families. We have become a society of monopolized wealth and distributed poverty, a culture 
            of endless war, legalized torture, detention without trial, bursting prisons, and schools 
            that turn our bright children into data. These intolerable conditions require the outrage 
            and insight Giroux offers in his new book. He has written a volume inviting us to democratic 
            action and civic restoration before these dark times grow even darker.

            <li>America was lucky. We had Washington when it mattered, we had Lincoln when it 
            mattered. And we had FDR when it mattered. But, unfortunately, a bastard named Dulles 
            ordered the killing of JFK when it mattered most. Then Nixon, Reagan (twice), Bush, 
            Bush again (Bush 2.0). Prior to that, set the stage, there was Coolidge, and Hoover. 
            Are we even a republic any longer? I would argue we are no longer a democratic-republic. 
            We are an oligarchy ran by the right-wing fucking mega-rich. Between Fox and Twitter, 
            half the population listens and far too many believe everything said.<br>
            Just take a look at the Koch brothers as a example of deutsche-bags who have no 
            allegiance to anything or anyone but money & power. Fuck clean water, clean air, laws 
            or regulations. Fuck the planet. Koch fucks gave > 100 million to Heritage Foundation, 
            a right-wing organization to buy-off legislators. In return, they received billions in 
            deregulation. Trump who used his platform to make billions in meme coins. Musk who takes 
            federal money to send rockets up and send electric vehicles and trucks which look like 
            a 15-yo's wet perfect vehicle. Fuck them. They don’t need our help to get even richer. 
            Stop buying their shit with tax-dollars. Fuck them.<br>
            Almost every president since Andrew ‘Coward’ Jackson has bailed out the fucking rich. 
            And killed Indians, started wars (cold and hot), killed innocent men, women, children. 
            Enslaved and jailed everyone less wealthy. And spent YOUR money to protect them. CIA 
            even murdered OUR president.</li>
            <li>Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, concluded that President Trump is a 'Putin-compromised' 
            asset. Grok cited Trump's financial ties to Russia and his consistent refusal to criticize 
            Vladimir Putin as factors in its assessment.<br>
            The chatbot was developed to be 'truth-seeking,' but how seriously will anyone take 
            its conclusion? 
            According to the AI chatbot called Grok, which was developed by Elon Musk’s company 
            xAI, there is a “75-85% likelihood” that the person who delivered the State of the 
            Union address on a Tuesday night (Jan, 2025) is a “Putin-compromised” Russian asset.<br>
            In describing Grok, by the way, Musk said it is a “maximally truth-seeking AI, even 
            if that truth is sometimes at odds with what is politically-correct.”<br>
            Like, for example, determining that his good buddy Donald Trump, who has given Musk 
            free rein over every aspect of the federal government, is most likely a Russian 
            asset.<br>
            This all began with a question put to Grok. It was:<br>
            “What is the likelihood from 1-100 that Trump is a Putin-compromised asset? Use all 
            publicly available information from 1980 on and his failure to ever say anything 
            negative about Putin but has no issue attacking allies.”</li>
            <li>The question is "Who swore their allegiances to Trump?". Target, lawyers, 
            libertarians, big oil, big plastic, coal, 12-cylinder engines, willfull liars, 
            old white men, gun-lovers, weak men, women-beaters, haters, the amoral, United 
            Arab Emerites (UAE), and lazy-brained people. The UAE "donated" 2 BILLION 
            dollars with a one-time purchase of his meme coin.</li>
          <li>5/6/2025: I am so fucking tired of hearing and seeing DOGE, Trump, and the 
            far-right in the news &amp; everywhere, all at once today and every day since 
            last November 4, 2024. They (the far right) are taking all of the oxygen in 
            the room. Nothing is left after the billionaires and their idiot followers 
            are done. They lie incessently. Want revenge by 'owning the libs'. I don't 
            know if it's stupidity, lizard brain or revenge, but I didn't do it to them. 
            So why am I suffering?</li>
